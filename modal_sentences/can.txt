However , there is evidence of glutamic acid decarboxylase ( GAD ) and GABA receptor expression about the time of neural tube formation [ 27 ] . Given that GABA is important to neural development , and the early developmental time frame of the GABA system , it is logical that agents active at the GABA receptor ( ethanol , BDZs ) can have adverse consequences on CNS development .
Because of the complex interdependence of TEC and thymocyte differentiation , defects in fetal TEC development can be caused either directly by cell-autonomous TEC differentiation defects , or indirectly by defective thymocyte maturation .

What is known about transmission patterns in the general US population is based on studies undertaken during outbreaks of the disease , usually waterborne [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ] . Even though cryptosporidiosis is a reportable disease , limited data are available on the routes of endemic transmission and on accurate incidence rates of cryptosporidiosis , especially in the immunocompetent population .

In inflammation , macrophages make a large contribution to intimal thickening , where these cells increase in number and proportion [ 3 ] . Evidence indicates that intimal macrophages arrive via the circulation as monocytes [ 4 ] , and it is proposed that increased numbers of intimal macrophages in RA are largely attributed to enhanced monocyte recruitment from blood vessels in the synovium [ 1 5 ] .

As an academic critic and university teacher specializing in modern literature and literary theory , I spend much or my time these days reading books and articles that I can barely understand and that cause my wife ( a graduate with a good honours degree in English language and literature ) to utter loud cries of pain and nausea if her eye happens to fall on them .

Anger and impulse do n't seem to be a part of his make-up : when he parodies the swaggering Hotspur , we can already see the fastidious distaste for self-dramatisation that will make him disown Falstaff , just as , when he imitates his father , we can see the strength this quiet man derives from the stately deliberation of majesty .

" Emma never thinks of herself , if she can do good to others ," rejoined Mr . Woodhouse , understanding but in part .
Depend upon it , a man of six or seven - and - twenty can take care of himself ."
She lived with her single daughter in a very small way , and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady , under such untoward circumstances , can excite .

There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman ' s daughter , and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power , or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you ."
But while I visit at Hartfield , and you are so kind to me , Miss Woodhouse , I am not afraid of what any body can do ."
But if he marries a very ignorant , vulgar woman , certainly I had better not visit her , if I can help it ."
You are so much used to live alone , that you do not know the value of a companion ; and , perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex , after being used to it all her life .
I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith .
" I dare say ," replied Mrs . Weston , smiling , " that I thought so _then_ ;-- but since we have parted , I can never remember Emma ' s omitting to do any thing I wished ."
How can Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself , while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority ?
Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogether -- face and figure ?"
" I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind ; but excuse me , Mr . Knightley , if I take the liberty ( I consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma ' s mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith ' s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you .
" There does , indeed , seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present ," said Mrs . Weston , " as can well be ; and while she is so happy at Hartfield , I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr . Woodhouse ' s account .
" Well , if you give me such kind encouragement , Mr . Elton , I believe I shall try what I can do .
She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse ; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know ; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them , beyond the air and complexion , unless they are coarser featured than any of mama ' s children ever were .
He will connect himself well if he can ."
I can hardly imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well , if left quite to his own powers , and yet it is not the style of a woman ; no , certainly , it is too strong and concise ; not diffuse enough for a woman .
If she can hesitate as to ` Yes ,' she ought to say ` No ' directly .
" Miss Woodhouse , as you will not give me your opinion , I must do as well as I can by myself ; and I have now quite determined , and really almost made up my mind -- to refuse Mr . Martin .
A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked , or because he is attached to her , and can write a tolerable letter ."
The attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle - tattle of Highbury yet .
As the sun is out , I believe I had better take my three turns while I can .
I can think of but one thing -- Who is in love with her ?
At her age she can have no experience , and with her little wit , is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her .
She is not to pay for the offence of others , by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up .-- There can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman -- and a gentleman of fortune .-- Her allowance is very liberal ; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort .-- That she is a gentleman ' s daughter , is indubitable to me ; that she associates with gentlemen ' s daughters , no one , I apprehend , will deny .-- She is superior to Mr . Robert Martin ."
After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs . Goddard ' s hands to shift as she can ;-- to move , in short , in Mrs . Goddard ' s line , to have Mrs . Goddard ' s acquaintance .
" We think so very differently on this point , Mr . Knightley , that there can be no use in canvassing it .
I can imagine , that before she had seen any body superior , she might tolerate him .
" Robert Martin has no great loss -- if he can but think so ; and I hope it will not be long before he does .
He is as well acquainted with his own claims , as you can be with Harriet ' s .
" What can it be , Miss Woodhouse ?-- what can it be ?
What can it possibly be ?
Can it be woman ?
Can it be Neptune ?
That is _ship_ ;-- plain as it can be .-- Now for the cream .
There can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you ."
This , Harriet , is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us ."
Miss Woodhouse , what can we do about that ?"
Give me the book , I will write it down , and then there can be no possible reflection on you ."
It is such a pretty charade , my dear , that I can easily guess what fairy brought it .-- Nobody could have written so prettily , but you , Emma ."
But I can remember nothing ;-- not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention ; I can only recollect the first stanza ; and there are several .
And that is all that I can recollect of it -- but it is very clever all the way through .
Mr . John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th , and we ought to be thankful , papa , that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country , that two or three days are not to be taken out for the Abbey .
" Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here .
They will come and stand by my chair , and say , ` Grandpapa , can you give me a bit of string ?'
He wishes his boys to be active and hardy ; and if they misbehave , can give them a sharp word now and then ; but he is an affectionate father -- certainly Mr . John Knightley is an affectionate father .
But between _us_ , I am convinced there never can be any likeness , except in being unmarried ."
And the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first ; for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind , and sour the temper .
Those who can barely live , and who live perforce in a very small , and generally very inferior , society , may well be illiberal and cross .
There will be enough of them , in all probability , to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need .
There will be enough for every hope and every fear ; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent , it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder .
How trifling they make every thing else appear !-- I feel now as if I could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day ; and yet , who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind ?"
one can think of nothing else ."
If we feel for the wretched , enough to do all we can for them , the rest is empty sympathy , only distressing to ourselves ."
As for Isabella , she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr . Westons aside as much as she can ."
" Me , my love ," cried his wife , hearing and understanding only in part .-- " Are you talking about me ?-- I am sure nobody ought to be , or can be , a greater advocate for matrimony than I am ; and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving Hartfield , I should never have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world ; and as to slighting Mr . Weston , that excellent Mr . Weston , I think there is nothing he does not deserve .
I shall never forget his flying Henry ' s kite for him that very windy day last Easter -- and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note , at twelve o ' clock at night , on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham , I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence .-- If any body can deserve him , it must be Miss Taylor ."
Nobody is healthy in London , nobody can be .
He paused -- and growing cooler in a moment , added , with only sarcastic dryness , " If Mr . Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty , I should be as willing to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself ."
he can see ready wit in Harriet , but will not dine alone for her ."
With men he can be rational and unaffected , but when he has ladies to please , every feature works ."
It is the greatest absurdity -- Actually snowing at this moment !-- The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home -- and the folly of people ' s not staying comfortably at home when they can !
If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this , by any call of duty or business , what a hardship we should deem it ;-- and here are we , probably with rather thinner clothing than usual , setting forward voluntarily , without excuse , in defiance of the voice of nature , which tells man , in every thing given to his view or his feelings , to stay at home himself , and keep all under shelter that he can ;-- here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man ' s house , with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday , and may not be said and heard again to - morrow .
Emma smiled and answered --" My visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint , I hope ; but not even I can charm away a sore throat ; it is a most severe cold indeed .
One is so fenced and guarded from the weather , that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted .
Instead of forgetting him , his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of " Can it really be as my brother imagined ?
can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me ?-- Absurd and insufferable !"
In short , I can feel no dependence on his coming , and I wish Mr . Weston were less sanguine ."
" If he could stay only a couple of days , he ought to come ; and one can hardly conceive a young man ' s not having it in his power to do as much as that .
" One ought to be at Enscombe , and know the ways of the family , before one decides upon what he can do ," replied Mrs . Weston .
Another hour or two ' s snow can hardly make the road impassable ; and we are two carriages ; if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand .
" You had better order the carriage directly , my love ," said she ; " I dare say we shall be able to get along , if we set off directly ; and if we do come to any thing very bad , I can get out and walk .
and I can account for it only in one way ; you are not yourself , or you could not speak either to me , or of Harriet , in such a manner .
Mr . Elton , my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can express .
cried Mr . Elton , " what can be the meaning of this ?-- Miss Smith !-- I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence -- never paid her any attentions , but as your friend : never cared whether she were dead or alive , but as your friend .
who can think of Miss Smith , when Miss Woodhouse is near !
This proves that he can leave the Churchills ."
" Yes , sometimes he can ."
Nobody , who has not been in the interior of a family , can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be .
We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe , and with Mrs . Churchill ' s temper , before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do .
He may , at times , be able to do a great deal more than he can at others ."
" There is one thing , Emma , which a man can always do , if he chuses , and that is , his duty ; not by manoeuvring and finessing , but by vigour and resolution .
Mr . Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt , who have brought him up , and are to provide for him !-- Standing up in the middle of the room , I suppose , and speaking as loud as he could !-- How can you imagine such conduct practicable ?"
He would feel himself in the right ; and the declaration -- made , of course , as a man of sense would make it , in a proper manner -- would do him more good , raise him higher , fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on , than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do .
I can imagine , that if you , as you are , Mr . Knightley , were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr . Frank Churchill ' s situation , you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him ; and it might have a very good effect .
He may have as strong a sense of what would be right , as you can have , without being so equal , under particular circumstances , to act up to it ."
I can allow for the fears of the child , but not of the man .
He can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter , full of professions and falsehoods , and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father ' s having any right to complain .
They hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings : standing in a mother ' s place , but without a mother ' s affection to blind her .
Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations ?
No , Emma , your amiable young man can be amiable only in French , not in English .
He may be very ` aimable ,' have very good manners , and be very agreeable ; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people : nothing really amiable about him ."
" My idea of him is , that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body , and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable .
Whenever she is with us , Mrs . Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough ; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can .
I was reading it to Mrs . Cole , and since she went away , I was reading it again to my mother , for it is such a pleasure to her -- a letter from Jane -- that she can never hear it often enough ; so I knew it could not be far off , and here it is , only just under my huswife -- and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says ;-- but , first of all , I really must , in justice to Jane , apologise for her writing so short a letter -- only two pages you see -- hardly two -- and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half .
My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well .
And , indeed , though my mother ' s eyes are not so good as they were , she can see amazingly well still , thank God !
I am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury , as they can be to see her .
They want her ( Mr . and Mrs . Dixon ) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs . Campbell ; quite depend upon it ; nothing can be more kind or pressing than their _joint_ invitation , Jane says , as you will hear presently ; Mr . Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention .
Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth , when they were out in that party on the water , and she , by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails , would have been dashed into the sea at once , and actually was all but gone , if he had not , with the greatest presence of mind , caught hold of her habit -- ( I can never think of it without trembling !)
Well , now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about , we will turn to her letter , and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her ."
Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do ; and at eighteen or nineteen she was , as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children , fully competent to the office of instruction herself ; but she was too much beloved to be parted with .
They had music ; Emma was obliged to play ; and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour , an air of greatness , meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance .
and I have often wished -- but it is so little one can venture to do -- small , trifling presents , of any thing uncommon -- Now we have killed a porker , and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg ; it is very small and delicate -- Hartfield pork is not like any other pork -- but still it is pork -- and , my dear Emma , unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks , nicely fried , as ours are fried , without the smallest grease , and not roast it , for no stomach can bear roast pork -- I think we had better send the leg -- do not you think so , my dear ?"
" As to who , or what Miss Hawkins is , or how long he has been acquainted with her ," said Emma , " nothing I suppose can be known .
By that time , it was beginning to hold up , and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away -- and then -- only think !-- I found he was coming up towards me too -- slowly you know , and as if he did not quite know what to do ; and so he came and spoke , and I answered -- and I stood for a minute , feeling dreadfully , you know , one can ' t tell how ; and then I took courage , and said it did not rain , and I must go ; and so off I set ; and I had not got three yards from the door , when he came after me , only to say , if I was going to Hartfield , he thought I had much better go round by Mr . Cole ' s stables , for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain .
" It might be distressing , for the moment ," said she ; " but you seem to have behaved extremely well ; and it is over -- and may never -- can never , as a first meeting , occur again , and therefore you need not think about it ."
" It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it ," said the young man , " though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far ; but in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing ."
" My dear sir , upon no account in the world ; my father can direct me ."
" But your father is not going so far ; he is only going to the Crown , quite on the other side of the street , and there are a great many houses ; you might be very much at a loss , and it is a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street ."
" Ill , very ill -- that is , if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill .
Ladies can never look ill . And , seriously , Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale , as almost always to give the appearance of ill health .-- A most deplorable want of complexion ."
I can only say that there was smoothness outwardly .
But you , who have known Miss Fairfax from a child , must be a better judge of her character , and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations , than I can be ."
In general he was judged , throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury , with great candour ; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man -- one who smiled so often and bowed so well ; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened , from its power of censure , by bows or smiles -- Mr . Knightley .
" Well , sir ," cried Mr . Weston , " as I took Miss Taylor away , it is incumbent on me to supply her place , if I can ; and I will step to Mrs . Goddard in a moment , if you wish it ."
" One can suppose nothing else ," added Mrs . Cole , " and I was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt .
and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr . Cole , I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing - room , while I do not know one note from another , and our little girls , who are but just beginning , perhaps may never make any thing of it ; and there is poor Jane Fairfax , who is mistress of music , has not any thing of the nature of an instrument , not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world , to amuse herself with .-- I was saying this to Mr . Cole but yesterday , and he quite agreed with me ; only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase , hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can ; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought -- or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it .-- We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening ."
If Colonel Campbell is not the person , who can be ?"
As to the pretence of trying her native air , I look upon that as a mere excuse .-- In the summer it might have passed ; but what can any body ' s native air do for them in the months of January , February , and March ?
Mr . Dixon ' s preference of her music to her friend ' s , I can answer for being very decided ."
And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love ."
I have no pleasure in seeing my friends , unless I can believe myself fit to be seen ."
" This is the luxury of a large party ," said she :--" one can get near every body , and say every thing .
Excepting inequality of fortune , and perhaps a little disparity of age , I can see nothing unsuitable ."
" Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love .
A mind lively and at ease , can do with seeing nothing , and can see nothing that does not answer .
" I do not believe any such thing ," replied Emma .--" I am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours , when it is necessary ; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent .
Then the baked apples came home , Mrs . Wallis sent them by her boy ; they are extremely civil and obliging to us , the Wallises , always -- I have heard some people say that Mrs . Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer , but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them .
said he , ` I do think I can fasten the rivet ; I like a job of this kind excessively .'
said he , ` I can fasten the rivet .
` I am sure you must be ,' said he , ` and I will send you another supply ; for I have a great many more than I can ever use .
" Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell ," said she , in a voice of forced calmness , " I can imagine nothing with any confidence .
I will not open the window here ; it would give you all cold ; but I can go into my mother ' s room you know .
Can I do any thing for you ?"
Can I do any thing for _you_ ?"
I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can ."
very delightful indeed ; I can say nothing less , for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr . Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes .
He never can bear to be thanked .
` Can I do any thing for you at Kingston ?'
It can be allowable only as the thought of the moment ."
Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd -- and a crowd in a little room !"
Better accommodations , he can promise them , and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls .
" It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to , if Mr . and Mrs . Weston do not .
I think it admirable ; and , as far as I can answer for myself , shall be most happy -- It seems the only improvement that could be .
But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father ' s house ."
If Mr . and Mrs . Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning , we may talk it over , and see what can be done ."
If it can be contrived to be at the Crown , papa , it will be very convenient for the horses .
Not that James ever complains ; but it is right to spare our horses when we can .
" I can answer for every thing of that nature , sir , because it will be under Mrs . Weston ' s care .
They can do nothing satisfactorily without you ."
Can the old lady ?"
yes , I must be there ; I could not refuse ; and I will keep as much awake as I can ; but I would rather be at home , looking over William Larkins ' s week ' s account ; much rather , I confess .-- Pleasure in seeing dancing !-- not I , indeed -- I never look at it -- I do not know who does .-- Fine dancing , I believe , like virtue , must be its own reward .
" If I can come again , we are still to have our ball .
Happy those , who can remain at Highbury !"
" In short ," said he , " perhaps , Miss Woodhouse -- I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion "--
He stopt again , rose again , and seemed quite embarrassed .-- He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed ; and who can say how it might have ended , if his father had not made his appearance ?
Not that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto .
This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is ; but I do not know that I expect it will ; I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man -- I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy .-- His feelings are warm , but I can imagine them rather changeable .-- Every consideration of the subject , in short , makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved .-- I shall do very well again after a little while -- and then , it will be a good thing over ; for they say every body is in love once in their lives , and I shall have been let off easily ."
But stranger things have happened ; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now , it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure ."
" Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr . Elton ' s marrying , Harriet , is the strongest reproach you can make _me_ .
No , indeed , Miss Woodhouse , you need not be afraid ; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery .
Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am .
` But ,' said I , ` to be quite honest , I do not think I can live without something of a musical society .
" But you , who are so extremely fond of it -- there can be no danger , surely ?"
And the same may be said of Mrs . Jeffereys -- Clara Partridge , that was -- and of the two Milmans , now Mrs . Bird and Mrs . James Cooper ; and of more than I can enumerate .
" I cannot think there is any danger of it ," was Emma ' s calm answer -- " and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax ' s situation and understand what her home has been , with Colonel and Mrs . Campbell , I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown ."
One can see that she feels the want of encouragement .
I assure you , Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character , and interests me more than I can express ."
" You appear to feel a great deal -- but I am not aware how you or any of Miss Fairfax ' s acquaintance here , any of those who have known her longer than yourself , can shew her any other attention than "--
If _we_ set the example , many will follow it as far as they can ; though all have not our situations .
Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be -- for we do not at all affect to equal my brother , Mr . Suckling , in income .-- However , my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax .-- I shall certainly have her very often at my house , shall introduce her wherever I can , shall have musical parties to draw out her talents , and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation .
You may have done wrong with regard to Mr . Dixon , but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited !-- The kindness and protection of Mrs .
Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs . Elton ' s way before -- and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action , if not in consciousness ."
" That will never be , however , I can assure you .
How can she find any appellation for them , deep enough in familiar vulgarity ?
She calls you , Knightley -- what can she do for Mr . Cole ?
I can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates , than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax ' s mind over Mrs . Elton .
I can easily believe that letters are very little to you , much less than to me , but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference , it is not age , but situation .
That will obviate all difficulties you know ; and from _us_ I really think , my dear Jane , you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation ."
I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can , I must walk somewhere , and the post - office is an object ; and upon my word , I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before ."
The thing is determined , that is ( laughing affectedly ) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master .
But for that reason , I should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females , for boys have very little teaching after an early age , and scramble into any hand they can get .
Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase ?-- Your Yorkshire friend -- your correspondent in Yorkshire ;-- that would be the way , I suppose , if I were very bad .-- No , I can pronounce his name without the smallest distress .
" Well , well , I have that note ; and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr .
said Jane , shaking her head ; " dear Mrs . Elton , who can have thought of it as I have done ?"
You are afraid of giving me trouble ; but I assure you , my dear Jane , the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am .
Nothing can stand more retired from the road than Maple Grove .
A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at West Hall ; and how they got their fortune nobody knows .
" There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be .
I can understand you --( nodding at Mr . John Knightley )-- your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here , delights you too much to pass unnoticed .
Never better .-- Don ' t I hear another carriage ?-- Who can this be ?-- very likely the worthy Coles .-- Upon my word , this is charming to be standing about among such friends !
Mrs . Elton then said , " Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do -- but upon such an occasion as this , when every body ' s eyes are so much upon me , and in compliment to the Westons -- who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour -- I would not wish to be inferior to others .
" Can you trust me with such flatterers ?-- Does my vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong ?"
You have shewn that you can dance , and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper ."
I can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now .-- I do not care whether I meet him or not -- except that of the two I had rather not see him -- and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him -- but I do not envy his wife in the least ; I neither admire her nor envy her , as I have done : she is very charming , I dare say , and all that , but I think her very ill - tempered and disagreeable -- I shall never forget her look the other night !-- However , I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , I wish her no evil .-- No , let them be ever so happy together , it will not give me another moment ' s pang : and to convince you that I have been speaking truth , I am now going to destroy -- what I ought to have destroyed long ago -- what I ought never to have kept -- I know that very well ( blushing as she spoke ).-- However , now I will destroy it all -- and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence , that you may see how rational I am grown .
cried Emma , putting her hand before her face , and jumping up , " you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear .
" Yes , simpleton as I was !-- but I am quite ashamed of it now , and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them .
It is natural , and it is honourable .-- Yes , honourable , I think , to chuse so well and so gratefully .-- But that it will be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise .
Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can : at any rate do not let them carry you far , unless you are persuaded of his liking you .
I am glad he can afford it .
I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander -- but it will not do -- very sorry to check you in your first essay -- but indeed it will not do .
There is no admiration between them , I do assure you ; and the appearances which have caught you , have arisen from some peculiar circumstances -- feelings rather of a totally different nature -- it is impossible exactly to explain :-- there is a good deal of nonsense in it -- but the part which is capable of being communicated , which is sense , is , that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another , as any two beings in the world can be .
That is , I _presume_ it to be so on her side , and I can _answer_ for its being so on his .
" No ,"-- he calmly replied ,--" there is but one married woman in the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell , and that one is --"
" You certainly will meet them if I can prevail ; and I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home ."
Nothing can be more simple , you see .
And , by the bye , can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion ?-- Pray be sincere , Knightley .
You can borrow Mrs . Cole ' s .
It can be round in five minutes ."
She spoke with great agitation ; and Emma very feelingly replied , " That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now .
The greatest kindness you can shew me , will be to let me have my own way , and only say that I am gone when it is necessary ."
I can never bear to think of you all there without me ."
I can have no self - command without a motive .
And you can be always with me .
Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can .
" Yes , yes , pray pass _me_ ," added her husband , with a sort of sneering consciousness ; " _I_ have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Woodhouse , or any other young lady .
Peculiarly lucky !-- for as to any real knowledge of a person ' s disposition that Bath , or any public place , can give -- it is all nothing ; there can be no knowledge .
It is only by seeing women in their own homes , among their own set , just as they always are , that you can form any just judgment .
I would be understood to mean , that it can be only weak , irresolute characters , ( whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance ,) who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience , an oppression for ever ."
" By all means , if you can ."
I wish you could have heard how she talked of it -- with what candour and generosity .
You , whom she had known from an infant , whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour , to have you now , in thoughtless spirits , and the pride of the moment , laugh at her , humble her -- and before her niece , too -- and before others , many of whom ( certainly _some_ ,) would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment of her .-- This is not pleasant to you , Emma -- and it is very far from pleasant to me ; but I must , I will ,-- I will tell you truths while I can ; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel , and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now ."
She hoped no one could have said to her , " How could you be so unfeeling to your father ?-- I must , I will tell you truths while I can ."
-- ` I can see nobody ,' said she ; and up she got , and would go away ; and that was what made us keep you waiting -- and extremely sorry and ashamed we were .
Yes , indeed , there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it .
" Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning ?-- Do , if it be possible .
She would have ordered the carriage , and come to you , but she must see you _alone_ , and that you know --( nodding towards her father )-- Humph !-- Can you come ?"
But what can be the matter ?-- Is she really not ill ?"
She will break it to you better than I can .
Good Heavens !-- What can be to be _broke_ to me , that does not relate to one of that family ?"
I can hardly believe it .-- I thought I knew him ."
" Well ," said she at last , trying to recover herself ; " this is a circumstance which I must think of at least half a day , before I can at all comprehend it .
to look on , while repeated attentions were offering to another woman , before her face , and not resent it .-- That is a degree of placidity , which I can neither comprehend nor respect ."
On this article I can fully acquit him .
" If a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself , it is in a situation like Jane Fairfax ' s .-- Of such , one may almost say , that ` the world is not their ' s , nor the world ' s law .'"
" Had you any idea ," cried Harriet , " of his being in love with her ?-- You , perhaps , might .-- You ( blushing as she spoke ) who can see into every body ' s heart ; but nobody else --"
Can you seriously ask me , Harriet , whether I imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that I was -- tacitly , if not openly -- encouraging you to give way to your own feelings ?-- I never had the slightest suspicion , till within the last hour , of Mr . Frank Churchill ' s having the least regard for Jane Fairfax .
` I will not say , that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments ; but I can say , that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour :'-- and the quivering lip , Emma , which uttered it , was an attestation that I felt at my heart ."
No one , I believe , can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself .
But after all the punishment that misconduct can bring , it is still not less misconduct .
I never can be blameless .
-- but checking himself --" No , no , I understand you -- forgive me -- I am pleased that you can say even so much .-- He is no object of regret , indeed !
And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour .
" I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill .-- I can suppose , however , that I may have underrated him .
What years of felicity that man , in all human calculation , has before him !-- Assured of the love of such a woman -- the disinterested love , for Jane Fairfax ' s character vouches for her disinterestedness ; every thing in his favour ,-- equality of situation -- I mean , as far as regards society , and all the habits and manners that are important ; equality in every point but one -- and that one , since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted , such as must increase his felicity , for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants .-- A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from ; and he who can do it , where there is no doubt of _her_ regard , must , I think , be the happiest of mortals .-- Frank Churchill is , indeed , the favourite of fortune .
God knows , I have been a very indifferent lover .-- But you understand me .-- Yes , you see , you understand my feelings -- and will return them if you can .
Seldom , very seldom , does complete truth belong to any human disclosure ; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised , or a little mistaken ; but where , as in this case , though the conduct is mistaken , the feelings are not , it may not be very material .-- Mr . Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she possessed , or a heart more disposed to accept of his .
" If I made myself intelligible yesterday , this letter will be expected ; but expected or not , I know it will be read with candour and indulgence .-- You are all goodness , and I believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct .-- But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent .
If you need farther explanation , I have the honour , my dear madam , of being your husband ' s son , and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good , which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of .-- See me , then , under these circumstances , arriving on my first visit to Randalls ;-- and here I am conscious of wrong , for that visit might have been sooner paid .
You will soon , I earnestly hope , know her thoroughly yourself .-- No description can describe her .
And here I can admit , that my manners to Miss W ., in being unpleasant to Miss F ., were highly blameable .
Had you witnessed my behaviour there , I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again .
But it is done ; we are reconciled , dearer , much dearer , than ever , and no moment ' s uneasiness can ever occur between us again .
" Well , there _is_ feeling here .-- He does seem to have suffered in finding her ill .-- Certainly , I can have no doubt of his being fond of her .
" We can finish this some other time , you know .
You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared .-- Here have I been sitting this hour , giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience -- for who can say , you know , how soon it may be wanted ?"
Perhaps to Hartfield , perhaps to the Abbey Mill , perhaps into his woods .-- Miss Woodhouse , this is not like our friend Knightley !-- Can you explain it ?"
as to all that , of course nothing can be thought of yet .
" Nothing can be actually settled yet , perhaps ," replied Emma , smiling --" but , excuse me , it must be thought of ."
" Impossible !-- I never can call you any thing but ` Mr .
I wish I may not sink into ` poor Emma ' with him at once .-- His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther ."
he cried , " I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as John will be , of our having every right that equal worth can give , to be happy together .
but why so ?-- I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you , should not please and amuse me too ."
This is all that I can relate of the how , where , and when .
Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her .-- She will give you all the minute particulars , which only woman ' s language can make interesting .-- In our communications we deal only in the great .-- However , I must say , that Robert Martin ' s heart seemed for _him_ , and to _me_ , very overflowing ; and that he did mention , without its being much to the purpose , that on quitting their box at Astley ' s , my brother took charge of Mrs . John Knightley and little John , and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry ; and that at one time they were in such a crowd , as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy ."
In respectability of character , there can be no doubt that they are .
I could suppose she might in time -- but can she already ?-- Did not you misunderstand him ?-- You were both talking of other things ; of business , shows of cattle , or new drills -- and might not you , in the confusion of so many subjects , mistake him ?-- It was not Harriet ' s hand that he was certain of -- it was the dimensions of some famous ox ."
" I am quite sure ," he replied , speaking very distinctly , " that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so .
" I can never think of it ," she cried , " without extreme shame ."
no , no , no -- how can you suspect me of such a thing ?
You can have no superior , but most true on mine .-- She is a complete angel .
" I can never think of it without laughing .-- She hears us , she hears us , Miss Woodhouse .
Do not you see that , at this instant , the very passage of her own letter , which sent me the report , is passing under her eye -- that the whole blunder is spread before her -- that she can attend to nothing else , though pretending to listen to the others ?"
" How you can bear such recollections , is astonishing to me !-- They _will_ sometimes obtrude -- but how you can court them !"
He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town ; he had gone so far even as to say , " Can we retrench ?
Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench ?"
" If we can persuade your father to all this ," said Lady Russell , looking over her paper , " much may be done .
The park would be open to him of course , and few navy officers , or men of any other description , can have had such a range ; but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure - grounds , is another thing .
" The navy , I think , who have done so much for us , have at least an equal claim with any other set of men , for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give .
One day last spring , in town , I was in company with two men , striking instances of what I am talking of ; Lord St Ives , whose father we all know to have been a country curate , without bread to eat ; I was to give place to Lord St Ives , and a certain Admiral Baldwin , the most deplorable - looking personage you can imagine ; his face the colour of mahogany , rough and rugged to the last degree ; all lines and wrinkles , nine grey hairs of a side , and nothing but a dab of powder at top .
I never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea - faring life can do ; but to a degree , I know it is the same with them all : they are all knocked about , and exposed to every climate , and every weather , till they are not fit to be seen .
In fact , as I have long been convinced , though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn , it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any , who can live in a regular way , in the country , choosing their own hours , following their own pursuits , and living on their own property , without the torment of trying for more ; it is only their lot , I say , to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost : I know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young ."
Penelope , my dear , can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at Monkford : Mrs Croft ' s brother ?"
" I have no conception whom you can mean , Shepherd ; I remember no gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent ."
An admiral speaks his own consequence , and , at the same time , can never make a baronet look small .
" Mrs Clay ," said she , warmly , " never forgets who she is ; and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be , I can assure you , that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice , and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people .
But poor Mrs Clay who , with all her merits , can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty , I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety .
" I think very differently ," answered Elizabeth , shortly ; " an agreeable manner may set off handsome features , but can never alter plain ones .
However , at any rate , as I have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have , I think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me ."
I am so ill I can hardly speak .
" I can give you no account of them .
what can you possibly have to do ?"
More than I can recollect in a moment ; but I can tell you some .
However , we may as well go and sit with them a little while , and when we have that over , we can enjoy our walk ."
I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener ; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment ; " don ' t do this ," and " don ' t do that ;" or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them ."
And on Mrs Musgrove ' s side , it was , " I make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughter - in - law ' s concerns , for I know it would not do ; but I shall tell you , Miss Anne , because you may be able to set things to rights , that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles ' s nursery - maid : I hear strange stories of her ; she is always upon the gad ; and from my own knowledge , I can declare , she is such a fine - dressing lady , that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near .
So we must be as merry as we can , that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things ."
" Nothing can be going on better than the child ," said he ; " so I told my father , just now , that I would come , and he thought me quite right .
You would not like to leave him yourself , but you see I can be of no use .
" Yes ; you see his papa can , and why should not I ?
You can make little Charles do anything ; he always minds you at a word .
I shall certainly go ; I am sure I ought if I can , quite as much as Charles , for they want me excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth , and I know you do not mind being left alone .
You can send for us , you know , at a moment ' s notice , if anything is the matter ; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you .
" I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire .
There can be no want of gallantry , Admiral , in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high , and this is what I do .
I hate to hear of women on board , or to see them on board ; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere , if I can help it ."
I can only say , ` No , I shall not ;' and then they say again , ` Yes , you will ,' and there is an end of it ."
" And I do assure you , ma ' am ," pursued Mrs Croft , " that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man - of - war ; I speak , you know , of the higher rates .
When you come to a frigate , of course , you are more confined ; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them ; and I can safely say , that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship .
No , no ; Henrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter ; and if she has him , and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth , I shall be very well satisfied ."
When people come in this manner on purpose to ask us , how can one say no ?"
If you value her conduct or happiness , infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can .
It is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character , that no influence over it can be depended on .
This nut ," he continued , with playful solemnity , " while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot , is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of ."
There can be no doubt of its having been of the greatest service to Dr Shirley , after his illness , last spring twelve - month .
" Pray ," said Captain Wentworth , immediately , " can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away ?"
It is bad for him , I know , to be shut up as he is ; but what can we do ?
" No ," said Anne , " that I can easily believe to be impossible ; but in time , perhaps -- we know what time does in every case of affliction , and you must remember , Captain Harville , that your friend may yet be called a young mourner -- only last summer , I understand ."
I can support her myself .
You can slip in from the shrubbery at any time ; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door .
And take it altogether , now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge , there is not one that we like better than this .
" And that you are very likely to do very soon , I can tell you , ma ' am ," said Charles .
I have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions .
There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally thinking of Captain Benwick , from this time .
His manners were an immediate recommendation ; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial , that she was at first , as she told Anne , almost ready to exclaim , " Can this be Mr Elliot ?"
She had a large acquaintance , of course professionally , among those who can afford to buy , and she disposes of my merchandise .
Anne , far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure , replied , " I can easily believe it .
And it is not merely in its follies , that they are well read ; for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting .
" No , sir , she is not one - and - thirty ; but I do not think I can put off my engagement , because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself .
I can leave them at the Great House very well , for a month or six weeks .
" I do not know ; but I can hardly suppose that , at Admiral Croft ' s time of life , and in his profession , he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this ."
I can never get by this shop without stopping .
Can I go anywhere for you , or with you ?
Can I be of any use ?"
We do not like our lodgings here the worse , I can tell you , for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth .
One can guess what will happen there .
They described the drawing - room window - curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way , and this part of the street , as being the handsomest and best hung of any in Bath , but could not recollect the exact number , and I have been trying to find out which it could be ; but I confess I can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description ."
Mrs Smith made no reply ; but when she was leaving her said , and with an expression half serious , half arch , " Well , I heartily wish your concert may answer ; and do not fail me to - morrow if you can come ; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have many more visits from you ."
" This ," said she , " is nearly the sense , or rather the meaning of the words , for certainly the sense of an Italian love - song must not be talked of , but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give ; for I do not pretend to understand the language .
You can have been acquainted with it only since I came to Bath , excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family ."
No one can withstand the charm of such a mystery .
I can understand .
He can be of essential service to me ; and if you would have the goodness , my dear Miss Elliot , to make it an object to yourself , of course it is done ."
Where can you look for a more suitable match ?
I am sure you hear nothing but good of him from Colonel Wallis ; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis ?"
Let him know me to be a friend of yours , and then he will think little of the trouble required , which it is very natural for him now , with so many affairs and engagements of his own , to avoid and get rid of as he can ; very natural , perhaps .
" No ," said Anne , " I can readily believe all that of my cousin .
Those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin , he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction .
I can satisfy you , perhaps , on points which you would little expect ; and as to his marriage , I knew all about it at the time .
I was privy to all the fors and againsts ; I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans ; and though I did not know his wife previously , her inferior situation in society , indeed , rendered that impossible , yet I knew her all her life afterwards , or at least till within the last two years of her life , and can answer any question you may wish to put ."
That was his motive for drawing back , I can assure you .
The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him before our marriage , and happened to be saved ; why , one can hardly imagine .
I have now another motive for being glad that I can produce it ."
The name of Walter I can drop , thank God !
Can any thing be stronger ?"
" I can explain this too ," cried Mrs Smith , smiling .
" Can you really ?"
I cannot produce written proof again , but I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire , of what he is now wanting , and what he is now doing .
Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many , to be misconceived by folly in one , and ignorance in another , can hardly have much truth left ."
You will soon be able to judge of the general credit due , by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm .
You can imagine what an artful man would do ; and with this guide , perhaps , may recollect what you have seen him do ."
But since he must be absent some time or other , I do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence .
She must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony , you know ; and ( since self will intrude ) who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot , through Mrs Wallis ' s recommendation ?"
I have a great value for Benwick ; and when one can but get him to talk , he has plenty to say .
how can you think of such a thing ?
How can you be so forgetful ?"
He had been prevented setting off for Thornberry , but I really forget by what ; for I was in a hurry , and could not much attend , and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return .
To begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying , I hold to be very unsafe and unwise , and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can ."
I hope I can allow for him .
" That I can easily believe ."
We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point .
If I could explain to you all this , and all that a man can bear and do , and glories to do , for the sake of these treasures of his existence !
" I can listen no longer in silence .
Can you fail to have understood my wishes ?
I can hardly write .
You sink your voice , but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others .
Who can be in doubt of what followed ?
There is a quickness of perception in some , a nicety in the discernment of character , a natural penetration , in short , which no experience in others can equal , and Lady Russell had been less gifted in this part of understanding than her young friend .
Consider ," she added , " that when the money is once parted with , it never can return .
No one , at least , can think I have not done enough for them : even themselves , they can hardly expect more ."
" There is no knowing what THEY may expect ," said the lady , " but we are not to think of their expectations : the question is , what you can afford to do ."
" To be sure it is ; and , indeed , it strikes me that they can want no addition at all .
Altogether , they will have five hundred a - year amongst them , and what on earth can four women want for more than that ?-- They will live so cheap !
They will have no carriage , no horses , and hardly any servants ; they will keep no company , and can have no expenses of any kind !
When my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can .
A great deal too handsome , in my opinion , for any place THEY can ever afford to live in .
Music seems scarcely to attract him , and though he admires Elinor ' s drawings very much , it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth .
Mama , the more I know of the world , the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love .
" Of his sense and his goodness ," continued Elinor , " no one can , I think , be in doubt , who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation .
The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent .
At first sight , his address is certainly not striking ; and his person can hardly be called handsome , till the expression of his eyes , which are uncommonly good , and the general sweetness of his countenance , is perceived .
A room or two can easily be added ; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me , I am sure I will find none in accommodating them ."
happy house , could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot , from whence perhaps I may view you no more !-- And you , ye well - known trees !-- but you will continue the same .-- No leaf will decay because we are removed , nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer !-- No ; you will continue the same ; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion , and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade !-- But who will remain to enjoy you ?"
I can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother ; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs !"
" A woman of seven and twenty ," said Marianne , after pausing a moment , " can never hope to feel or inspire affection again , and if her home be uncomfortable , or her fortune small , I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse , for the sake of the provision and security of a wife .
" But he talked of flannel waistcoats ," said Marianne ; " and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches , cramps , rheumatisms , and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble ."
What else can detain him at Norland ?"
what can be the meaning of it !
" And is that all you can say for him ?"
On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence ; and he told them that Mr . Willoughby had no property of his own in the country ; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady at Allenham Court , to whom he was related , and whose possessions he was to inherit ; adding , " Yes , yes , he is very well worth catching I can tell you , Miss Dashwood ; he has a pretty little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides ; and if I were you , I would not give him up to my younger sister , in spite of all this tumbling down hills .
he is quite smitten already , and he is very well worth setting your cap at , I can tell you , in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles ."
Her form , though not so correct as her sister ' s , in having the advantage of height , was more striking ; and her face was so lovely , that when in the common cant of praise , she was called a beautiful girl , truth was less violently outraged than usually happens .
Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty , and second marriages , and then you can have nothing farther to ask ."
" In defence of your protege you can even be saucy ."
" I may venture to say that HIS observations have stretched much further than your candour .
I consider him , on the contrary , as a very respectable man , who has every body ' s good word , and nobody ' s notice ; who , has more money than he can spend , more time than he knows how to employ , and two new coats every year ."
I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man , well - bred , well - informed , of gentle address , and , I believe , possessing an amiable heart ."
You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful .
I shall keep it only till you can claim it .
" Yes , yes , we can guess where he is ; at his own house at Norland to be sure .
" What can you have to do in town at this time of year ?"
" I hope we shall see you at Barton ," added her ladyship , " as soon as you can conveniently leave town ; and we must put off the party to Whitwell till you return ."
" I can guess what his business is , however ," said Mrs . Jennings exultingly .
" Can you , ma ' am ?"
" Oh , yes ; and as like him as she can stare .
" Mr . Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew that house ; and as he went in an open carriage , it was impossible to have any other companion .
" On the contrary , nothing can be a stronger proof of it , Elinor ; for if there had been any real impropriety in what I did , I should have been sensible of it at the time , for we always know when we are acting wrong , and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure ."
I do think he must have been sent for about money matters , for what else can it be ?
I wonder what it can be !
" May she always be poor , if she can employ her riches no better ."
" There certainly are circumstances ," said Willoughby , " which might greatly endear it to me ; but this place will always have one claim of my affection , which no other can possibly share ."
How little did I then think that the very first news I should hear from Mrs . Smith , when I next came into the country , would be that Barton cottage was taken : and I felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event , which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I should experience from it , can account for .
For shame , Willoughby , can you wait for an invitation here ?"
" I have only to add , my dear Willoughby , that at Barton cottage you will always be welcome ; for I will not press you to return here immediately , because you only can judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs . Smith ; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination ."
What can it be ?
Can they have quarrelled ?
I have thought it all over I assure you , and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you ."
" Can you , indeed !"
I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way ;-- but you , Elinor , who love to doubt where you can -- it will not satisfy YOU , I know ; but you shall not talk ME out of my trust in it .
You will tell me , I know , that this may or may NOT have happened ; but I will listen to no cavil , unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this .
" I can hardly tell myself .
You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby , if , after all that has openly passed between them , you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together .
" But with a strange kind of tenderness , if he can leave her with such indifference , such carelessness of the future , as you attribute to him ."
can he be deceitful ?"
It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun , for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance ; and even secrecy , as far as it can be observed , may now be very advisable ."
Look up to it , and be tranquil if you can .
" How can you think of dirt , with such objects before you ?"
" Marianne ," cried her sister , " how can you say so ?
How can you be so unjust ?
said Marianne , " money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it .
Beyond a competence , it can afford no real satisfaction , as far as mere self is concerned ."
" Perhaps , then , you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim , that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life -- your opinion on that point is unchanged , I presume ?"
" I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes ," said Elinor , " in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other : fancying people so much more gay or grave , or ingenious or stupid than they really are , and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated .
What can you suppose ?"
You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give .
It exactly answers my idea of a fine country , because it unites beauty with utility -- and I dare say it is a picturesque one too , because you admire it ; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories , grey moss and brush wood , but these are all lost on me .
How can you ?-- But the time will come I hope ... I am sure you will like him ."
Charlotte is very pretty , I can tell you .
" You may believe how glad we all were to see them ," added Mrs . Jennings , leaning forward towards Elinor , and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard by no one else , though they were seated on different sides of the room ; " but , however , I can ' t help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast , nor made such a long journey of it , for they came all round by London upon account of some business , for you know ( nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter ) it was wrong in her situation .
I thought you would , he is so pleasant ; and Mr . Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can tell you , and you can ' t think how disappointed he will be if you don ' t come to Cleveland .-- I can ' t imagine why you should object to it ."
She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him , upon my honour ; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her , because she is so very handsome and agreeable , that nothing can be good enough for her .
You can ' t think how much I longed to see you !
Nothing can be like it , to be sure !
" Do come now ," said he --" pray come -- you must come -- I declare you shall come -- You can ' t think how you will like them .
How can you be so cross as not to come ?
" I think every one MUST admire it ," replied Elinor , " who ever saw the place ; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do ."
But I can ' t bear to see them dirty and nasty .
But this I can say , that if he ever was a beau before he married , he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him ."
Anne ," cried her sister , " you can talk of nothing but beaux ;-- you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing else ."
" How can you say so , Anne ?"
Can you be ?"
And I do not think Mr . Ferrars can be displeased , when he knows I have trusted you , because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family , and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as his own sisters ."
" We can mean no other ," cried Lucy , smiling .
Besides in the present case , I really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about Edward ' s mother ; and I am so unfortunate , that I have not a creature whose advice I can ask .
You can ' t think how much I go through in my mind from it altogether .
Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty ; and seeing him so seldom -- we can hardly meet above twice a - year .
" Pardon me ," replied Elinor , startled by the question ; " but I can give you no advice under such circumstances .
This hint was enough , Lucy recollected herself instantly and replied , " Indeed you are very much mistaken , Lady Middleton ; I am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me , or I should have been at my filigree already .
" Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know , ma ' am ," said Elinor , endeavouring to smooth away the offence ; " and I do not much wonder at it ; for it is the very best toned piano - forte I ever heard ."
" Indeed , I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you , to acknowledge your situation to me , and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it .
With almost every other man in the world , it would be an alarming prospect ; but Edward ' s affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of I know ."
I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment ' s alarm on that account from the first ."
" All this ," thought Elinor , " is very pretty ; but it can impose upon neither of us ."
" I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood ' s is not ," said Mrs . Jennings , laughing heartily ; " for he is one of the modestest , prettiest behaved young men I ever saw ; but as for Lucy , she is such a sly little creature , there is no finding out who SHE likes ."
I dare say you have seen enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession ; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can , and then through your interest , which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him , and I hope out of some regard to me , your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living ; which I understand is a very good one , and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while .
I am sure your mother can spare you very well , and I DO beg you will favour me with your company , for I ' ve quite set my heart upon it .
It will only be sending Betty by the coach , and I hope I can afford THAT .
how do you think I can live poking by myself , I who have been always used till this winter to have Charlotte with me .
You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman , of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt .
" My objection is this ; though I think very well of Mrs . Jennings ' s heart , she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure , or whose protection will give us consequence ."
However , I got a very good husband , and I don ' t know what the greatest beauty can do more .
In another day or two perhaps ; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer -- nay , perhaps it may freeze tonight !"
I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff .
" How can that be ?
By whom can you have heard it mentioned ?"
What can be the meaning of it ?
" How can that be done ?
how can you talk so ?
Because you are so sly about it yourself , you think nobody else has any senses ; but it is no such thing , I can tell you , for it has been known all over town this ever so long .
I am much concerned to find there was anything in my behaviour last night that did not meet your approbation ; and though I am quite at a loss to discover in what point I could be so unfortunate as to offend you , I entreat your forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been perfectly unintentional .
if you knew !-- And can you believe me to be so , while I see you so wretched !"
" Forgive me , forgive me ," throwing her arms round her sister ' s neck ; " I know you feel for me ; I know what a heart you have ; but yet you are -- you must be happy ; Edward loves you -- what , oh what , can do away such happiness as that ?"
You CAN have no grief ."
" I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state ."
Mine is a misery which nothing can do away ."
I have passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse a conduct which can scarcely be called less than insulting ; but though I have not yet been able to form any reasonable apology for your behaviour , I am perfectly ready to hear your justification of it .
" I can believe it ," said Elinor ; " but unfortunately he did not feel the same ."
Whatever may have changed him now , ( and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it ), I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish .
This lock of hair , which now he can so readily give up , was begged of me with the most earnest supplication .
When he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again -- his distress -- can I ever forget his distress ?"
By whom can he have been instigated ?"
I must feel -- I must be wretched -- and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can ."
who can require it ?"
Cruel , cruel -- nothing can acquit you .
Elinor , nothing can .
Oh , barbarously insolent !-- Elinor , can he be justified ?"
" And yet this woman -- who knows what her art may have been ?-- how long it may have been premeditated , and how deeply contrived by her !-- Who is she ?-- Who can she be ?-- Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance ?-- Oh !
Can not we be gone to - morrow ?"
Well , said I , all I can say is , that if this be true , he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill , and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out .
But that won ' t do now - a - days ; nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age ."
Is there nothing one can get to comfort her ?
I shall persuade her if I can to go early to bed , for I am sure she wants rest ."
" In this affair it can only do harm ; more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind , for it has been attended by circumstances which , for the sake of every one concerned in it , make it unfit to become the public conversation .
Delaford is a nice place , I can tell you ; exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place , full of comforts and conveniences ; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit - trees in the country ; and such a mulberry tree in one corner !
Well , I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can .
If we CAN but put Willoughby out of her head !"
" Ay , if we can do THAT , Ma ' am ," said Elinor , " we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon ."
" Who can this be ?"
Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn Marianne .
On such a subject ," sighing heavily , " can I have little temptation to be diffuse ."
And this , I fear , is all that can be said for the conduct of one , who was at once her uncle and guardian .
But can we wonder that , with such a husband to provoke inconstancy , and without a friend to advise or restrain her ( for my father lived only a few months after their marriage , and I was with my regiment in the East Indies ) she should fall ?
No , he had already done that , which no man who CAN feel for another would do .
But now , after such dishonorable usage , who can tell what were his designs on her .
They proceed from no misconduct , and can bring no disgrace .
" I have been more pained ," said she , " by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest ; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do .
" What a charming thing it is that Mrs . Dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together !"
" Oh , if that ' s all ," cried Miss Steele , " we can just as well go and see HER ."
Their attention to our comfort , their friendliness in every particular , is more than I can express ."
But so it ought to be ; they are people of large fortune , they are related to you , and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected .
But some of those little attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him , in spite of himself .
And there can be no reason why you should not try for him .
Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour ; and she can hardly do all this , without being aware of the expectation it raises ."
I know very little of Dorsetshire ; but , my dear Elinor , I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it ; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors ."
But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both ."
said Lucy , as they walked up the stairs together -- for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs . Jennings , that they all followed the servant at the same time --" There is nobody here but you , that can feel for me .-- I declare I can hardly stand .
" What can bring her here so often ?"
" Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations , no space in a cottage ; but this is all a mistake .
' But how can it be done ?'
There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple , and where can the supper be ?'
" I do not see how it can be done ," said she , " without affronting Lady Middleton , for they spend every day with her ; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it .
How can I ask them away from her ?"
We can ask your sisters some other year , you know ; but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more .
So then it all came out ; and the long and the short of the matter , by all I can learn , seems to be this .
Now , I can think and speak of it with little emotion .
Lucy does not want sense , and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built .-- And after all , Marianne , after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment , and all that can be said of one ' s happiness depending entirely on any particular person , it is not meant -- it is not fit -- it is not possible that it should be so .-- Edward will marry Lucy ; he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex ; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to HER ."
" I understand you .-- You do not suppose that I have ever felt much .-- For four months , Marianne , I have had all this hanging on my mind , without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature ; knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you , yet unable to prepare you for it in the least .-- It was told me ,-- it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself , whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects ; and told me , as I thought , with triumph .-- This person ' s suspicions , therefore , I have had to oppose , by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested ;-- and it has not been only once ;-- I have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again .-- I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever , without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection .-- Nothing has proved him unworthy ; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me .-- I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister , and the insolence of his mother ; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment , without enjoying its advantages .-- And all this has been going on at a time , when , as you know too well , it has not been my only unhappiness .-- If you can think me capable of ever feeling -- surely you may suppose that I have suffered NOW .
Elinor ," she cried , " you have made me hate myself for ever .-- How barbarous have I been to you !-- you , who have been my only comfort , who have borne with me in all my misery , who have seemed to be only suffering for me !-- Is this my gratitude ?-- Is this the only return I can make you ?-- Because your merit cries out upon myself , I have been trying to do it away ."
can this be possible !"
He left her house yesterday , but where he is gone , or whether he is still in town , I do not know ; for WE of course can make no inquiry ."
The interest of two thousand pounds -- how can a man live on it ?-- and when to that is added the recollection , that he might , but for his own folly , within three months have been in the receipt of two thousand , five hundred a - year ( for Miss Morton has thirty thousand pounds ,) I cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition .
" Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man ," continued John , " than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might have been his own ?
" Well , but Miss Dashwood ," speaking triumphantly , " people may say what they chuse about Mr . Ferrars ' s declaring he would not have Lucy , for it is no such thing I can tell you ; and it is quite a shame for such ill - natured reports to be spread abroad .
one can ' t repeat such kind of things you know )-- she told him directly , she had not the least mind in the world to be off , for she could live with him upon a trifle , and how little so ever he might have , she should be very glad to have it all , you know , or something of the kind .
Edward have got some business at Oxford , he says ; so he must go there for a time ; and after THAT , as soon as he can light upon a Bishop , he will be ordained .
" Wait for his having a living !-- ay , we all know how THAT will end :-- they will wait a twelvemonth , and finding no good comes of it , will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a - year , with the interest of his two thousand pounds , and what little matter Mr . Steele and Mr . Pratt can give her .-- Then they will have a child every year !
how poor they will be !-- I must see what I can give them towards furnishing their house .
He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time , but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake , and as a friend of yours , I wish it still more .
" This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr . Ferrars comfortable as a bachelor ; it cannot enable him to marry .
What I am now doing indeed , seems nothing at all , since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal , his only object of happiness .
But whether she would do for a lady ' s maid , I am sure I can ' t tell .
" Colonel Brandon give ME a living !-- Can it be possible ?"
" Really ," said Elinor , " I know so little of these kind of forms , that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time , or the preparation necessary ; but I suppose two or three months will complete his ordination ."
my dear , how calmly you talk of it ; and can the Colonel wait two or three months !
" My dear ma ' am ," said Elinor , " what can you be thinking of ?-- Why , Colonel Brandon ' s only object is to be of use to Mr .
" The Colonel is a ninny , my dear ; because he has two thousand a - year himself , he thinks that nobody else can marry on less .
This living of Colonel Brandon ' s -- can it be true ?-- has he really given it to Edward ?-- I heard it yesterday by chance , and was coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it ."
" But why should such precaution be used ?-- Though it is not to be supposed that Mrs . Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon ,-- for THAT must be quite out of the question ; yet why , upon her late behaviour , is she supposed to feel at all ?-- She has done with her son , she cast him off for ever , and has made all those over whom she had any influence , cast him off likewise .
Mrs . Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son ."
" Certainly , there can be no difference ; for Robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son ;-- and as to any thing else , they are both very agreeable young men : I do not know that one is superior to the other ."
-- in the utmost amazement --" well , sir ,-- be quick -- and if you can -- less violent ."
" I mean ,"-- said he , with serious energy --" if I can , to make you hate me one degree less than you do NOW .
To attach myself to your sister , therefore , was not a thing to be thought of ;-- and with a meanness , selfishness , cruelty -- which no indignant , no contemptuous look , even of yours , Miss Dashwood , can ever reprobate too much -- I was acting in this manner , trying to engage her regard , without a thought of returning it .-- But one thing may be said for me : even in that horrid state of selfish vanity , I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated , because I did not THEN know what it was to love .
If you CAN pity me , Miss Dashwood , pity my situation as it was THEN .
To treat her with unkindness , to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to Marianne -- nor can I suppose it a relief to your own conscience ."
" As to that ," said he , " I must rub through the world as well as I can .
She can never be more lost to you than she is now ."
And if that some one should be the very he whom , of all others , I could least bear -- but I will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill , by shewing that where I have most injured I can least forgive .
" His regard for her , infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby ever felt or feigned , as much more warm , as more sincere or constant -- which ever we are to call it -- has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear Marianne ' s unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man !-- and without selfishness -- without encouraging a hope !-- could he have seen her happy with another -- Such a noble mind !-- such openness , such sincerity !-- no one can be deceived in HIM ."
To Mrs . Jennings , to the Middletons , he has been long and intimately known ; they equally love and respect him ; and even my own knowledge of him , though lately acquired , is very considerable ; and so highly do I value and esteem him , that if Marianne can be happy with him , I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world .
But there are many works well worth reading at the Park ; and there are others of more modern production which I know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon .
" I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the spot !-- shall we ever talk on that subject , Elinor ?"
-- hesitatingly it was said .--" Or will it be wrong ?-- I can talk of it now , I hope , as I ought to do ."
> From you , from my home , I shall never again have the smallest incitement to move ; and if I do mix in other society , it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled , my heart amended , and that I can practise the civilities , the lesser duties of life , with gentleness and forbearance .
His remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions .
" I wish to assure you both ," said she , " that I see every thing -- as you can desire me to do ."
Some letters had passed between her and her brother , in consequence of Marianne ' s illness ; and in the first of John ' s , there had been this sentence :-- " We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward , and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a subject , but conclude him to be still at Oxford ;" which was all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence , for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters .
Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week ;-- for whatever other claims might be made on him , it was impossible that less than a week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor ' s company , or suffice to say half that was to be said of the past , the present , and the future ;-- for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in common between any two rational creatures , yet with lovers it is different .
I can safely say I owe you no ill - will , and am sure you will be too generous to do us any ill offices .
repeated he ; " would they have me beg my mother ' s pardon for Robert ' s ingratitude to HER , and breach of honour to ME ?-- I can make no submission -- I am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed .-- I am grown very happy ; but that would not interest .-- I know of no submission that IS proper for me to make ."
He had nothing to urge against it , but still resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission ; and therefore , to make it easier to him , as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by word of mouth than on paper , it was resolved that , instead of writing to Fanny , he should go to London , and personally intreat her good offices in his favour .-- " And if they really DO interest themselves ," said Marianne , in her new character of candour , " in bringing about a reconciliation , I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely without merit ."
His property here , his place , his house , every thing is in such respectable and excellent condition !-- and his woods !-- I have not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire , as there is now standing in Delaford Hanger !-- And though , perhaps , Marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him -- yet I think it would altogether be advisable for you to have them now frequently staying with you , for as Colonel Brandon seems a great deal at home , nobody can tell what may happen -- for , when people are much thrown together , and see little of anybody else -- and it will always be in your power to set her off to advantage , and so forth ;-- in short , you may as well give her a chance -- You understand me ."
4 : 13 And Cain said unto the LORD , My punishment is greater than I can bear .
9 : 18 And the sons of Noah , that went forth of the ark , were Shem , and Ham , and Japheth : and Ham is the father of Canaan .
9 : 22 And Ham , the father of Canaan , saw the nakedness of his father , and told his two brethren without .
9 : 25 And he said , Cursed be Canaan ; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren .
9 : 26 And he said , Blessed be the LORD God of Shem ; and Canaan shall be his servant .
9 : 27 God shall enlarge Japheth , and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem ; and Canaan shall be his servant .
10 : 6 And the sons of Ham ; Cush , and Mizraim , and Phut , and Canaan .
10 : 15 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born , and Heth , 10 : 16 And the Jebusite , and the Amorite , and the Girgasite , 10 : 17 And the Hivite , and the Arkite , and the Sinite , 10 : 18 And the Arvadite , and the Zemarite , and the Hamathite : and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad .
10 : 19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon , as thou comest to Gerar , unto Gaza ; as thou goest , unto Sodom , and Gomorrah , and Admah , and Zeboim , even unto Lasha .
11 : 31 And Terah took Abram his son , and Lot the son of Haran his son ' s son , and Sarai his daughter in law , his son Abram ' s wife ; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees , to go into the land of Canaan ; and they came unto Haran , and dwelt there .
12 : 5 And Abram took Sarai his wife , and Lot his brother ' s son , and all their substance that they had gathered , and the souls that they had gotten in Haran ; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan ; and into the land of Canaan they came .
And the Canaanite was then in the land .
13 : 7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram ' s cattle and the herdmen of Lot ' s cattle : and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land .
13 : 12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan , and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain , and pitched his tent toward Sodom .
13 : 16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth : so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then shall thy seed also be numbered .
15 : 18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram , saying , Unto thy seed have I given this land , from the river of Egypt unto the great river , the river Euphrates : 15 : 19 The Kenites , and the Kenizzites , and the Kadmonites , 15 : 20 And the Hittites , and the Perizzites , and the Rephaims , 15 : 21 And the Amorites , and the Canaanites , and the Girgashites , and the Jebusites .
16 : 3 And Sarai Abram ' s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian , after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan , and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife .
17 : 8 And I will give unto thee , and to thy seed after thee , the land wherein thou art a stranger , all the land of Canaan , for an everlasting possession ; and I will be their God .
23 : 2 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba ; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan : and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah , and to weep for her .
23 : 19 And after this , Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre : the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan .
24 : 2 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house , that ruled over all that he had , Put , I pray thee , thy hand under my thigh : 24 : 3 And I will make thee swear by the LORD , the God of heaven , and the God of the earth , that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites , among whom I dwell : 24 : 4 But thou shalt go unto my country , and to my kindred , and take a wife unto my son Isaac .
24 : 37 And my master made me swear , saying , Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites , in whose land I dwell : 24 : 38 But thou shalt go unto my father ' s house , and to my kindred , and take a wife unto my son .
28 : 1 And Isaac called Jacob , and blessed him , and charged him , and said unto him , Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan .
28 : 6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob , and sent him away to Padanaram , to take him a wife from thence ; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge , saying , Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughers of Canaan ; 28 : 7 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother , and was gone to Padanaram ; 28 : 8 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father ; 28 : 9 Then went Esau unto Ishmael , and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham ' s son , the sister of Nebajoth , to be his wife .
31 : 17 Then Jacob rose up , and set his sons and his wives upon camels ; 31 : 18 And he carried away all his cattle , and all his goods which he had gotten , the cattle of his getting , which he had gotten in Padanaram , for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan .
31 : 43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob , These daughters are my daughters , and these children are my children , and these cattle are my cattle , and all that thou seest is mine : and what can I do this day unto these my daughters , or unto their children which they have born ?
33 : 18 And Jacob came to Shalem , a city of Shechem , which is in the land of Canaan , when he came from Padanaram ; and pitched his tent before the city .
34 : 30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi , Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land , among the Canaanites and the Perizzites : and I being few in number , they shall gather themselves together against me , and slay me ; and I shall be destroyed , I and my house .
35 : 6 So Jacob came to Luz , which is in the land of Canaan , that is , Bethel , he and all the people that were with him .
36 : 2 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan ; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite , and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite ; 36 : 3 And Bashemath Ishmael ' s daughter , sister of Nebajoth .
36 : 4 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz ; and Bashemath bare Reuel ; 36 : 5 And Aholibamah bare Jeush , and Jaalam , and Korah : these are the sons of Esau , which were born unto him in the land of Canaan .
36 : 6 And Esau took his wives , and his sons , and his daughters , and all the persons of his house , and his cattle , and all his beasts , and all his substance , which he had got in the land of Canaan ; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob .
37 : 1 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger , in the land of Canaan .
38 : 2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite , whose name was Shuah ; and he took her , and went in unto her .
39 : 8 But he refused , and said unto his master ' s wife , Behold , my master wotteth not what is with me in the house , and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand ; 39 : 9 There is none greater in this house than I ; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee , because thou art his wife : how then can I do this great wickedness , and sin against God ?
41 : 15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph , I have dreamed a dream , and there is none that can interpret it : and I have heard say of thee , that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it .
41 : 38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants , Can we find such a one as this is , a man in whom the Spirit of God is ?
42 : 5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came : for the famine was in the land of Canaan .
And they said , From the land of Canaan to buy food .
42 : 13 And they said , Thy servants are twelve brethren , the sons of one man in the land of Canaan ; and , behold , the youngest is this day with our father , and one is not .
42 : 29 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan , and told him all that befell unto them ; saying , 42 : 30 The man , who is the lord of the land , spake roughly to us , and took us for spies of the country .
42 : 31 And we said unto him , We are true men ; we are no spies : 42 : 32 We be twelve brethren , sons of our father ; one is not , and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan .
44 : 1 And he commanded the steward of his house , saying , Fill the men ' s sacks with food , as much as they can carry , and put every man ' s money in his sack ' s mouth .
God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing : 44 : 8 Behold , the money , which we found in our sacks ' mouths , we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan : how then should we steal out of thy lord ' s house silver or gold ?
wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine ?
45 : 17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph , Say unto thy brethren , This do ye ; lade your beasts , and go , get you unto the land of Canaan ; 45 : 18 And take your father and your households , and come unto me : and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and ye shall eat the fat of the land .
45 : 25 And they went up out of Egypt , and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father , 45 : 26 And told him , saying , Joseph is yet alive , and he is governor over all the land of Egypt .
46 : 6 And they took their cattle , and their goods , which they had gotten in the land of Canaan , and came into Egypt , Jacob , and all his seed with him : 46 : 7 His sons , and his sons ' sons with him , his daughters , and his sons ' daughters , and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt .
46 : 10 And the sons of Simeon ; Jemuel , and Jamin , and Ohad , and Jachin , and Zohar , and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman .
46 : 12 And the sons of Judah ; Er , and Onan , and Shelah , and Pharez , and Zarah : but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan .
46 : 31 And Joseph said unto his brethren , and unto his father ' s house , I will go up , and shew Pharaoh , and say unto him , My brethren , and my father ' s house , which were in the land of Canaan , are come unto me ; 46 : 32 And the men are shepherds , for their trade hath been to feed cattle ; and they have brought their flocks , and their herds , and all that they have .
47 : 1 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh , and said , My father and my brethren , and their flocks , and their herds , and all that they have , are come out of the land of Canaan ; and , behold , they are in the land of Goshen .
47 : 4 They said morever unto Pharaoh , For to sojourn in the land are we come ; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks ; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan : now therefore , we pray thee , let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen .
47 : 13 And there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very sore , so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine .
47 : 14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , for the corn which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh ' s house .
47 : 15 And when money failed in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , all the Egyptians came unto Joseph , and said , Give us bread : for why should we die in thy presence ?
48 : 3 And Jacob said unto Joseph , God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan , and blessed me , 48 : 4 And said unto me , Behold , I will make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , and I will make of thee a multitude of people ; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession .
48 : 7 And as for me , when I came from Padan , Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way , when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath : and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath ; the same is Bethlehem .
49 : 29 And he charged them , and said unto them , I am to be gathered unto my people : bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite , 49 : 30 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah , which is before Mamre , in the land of Canaan , which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace .
50 : 4 And when the days of his mourning were past , Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh , saying , If now I have found grace in your eyes , speak , I pray you , in the ears of Pharaoh , saying , 50 : 5 My father made me swear , saying , Lo , I die : in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan , there shalt thou bury me .
50 : 11 And when the inhabitants of the land , the Canaanites , saw the mourning in the floor of Atad , they said , This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians : wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim , which is beyond Jordan .
50 : 12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them : 50 : 13 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan , and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah , which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite , before Mamre .
3 : 7 And the LORD said , I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt , and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters ; for I know their sorrows ; 3 : 8 And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians , and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large , unto a land flowing with milk and honey ; unto the place of the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites .
3 : 16 Go , and gather the elders of Israel together , and say unto them , The LORD God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Jacob , appeared unto me , saying , I have surely visited you , and seen that which is done to you in Egypt : 3 : 17 And I have said , I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , unto a land flowing with milk and honey .
I know that he can speak well .
5 : 11 Go ye , get you straw where ye can find it : yet not ought of your work shall be diminished .
6 : 4 And I have also established my covenant with them , to give them the land of Canaan , the land of their pilgrimage , wherein they were strangers .
6 : 15 And the sons of Simeon ; Jemuel , and Jamin , and Ohad , and Jachin , and Zohar , and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman : these are the families of Simeon .
13 : 5 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee , a land flowing with milk and honey , that thou shalt keep this service in this month .
13 : 11 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites , as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers , and shall give it thee , 13 : 12 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix , and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast ; the males shall be the LORD ' s .
15 : 15 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed ; the mighty men of Moab , trembling shall take hold upon them ; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away .
16 : 35 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years , until they came to a land inhabited ; they did eat manna , until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan .
23 : 23 For mine Angel shall go before thee , and bring thee in unto the Amorites , and the Hittites , and the Perizzites , and the Canaanites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites : and I will cut them off .
23 : 28 And I will send hornets before thee , which shall drive out the Hivite , the Canaanite , and the Hittite , from before thee .
33 : 1 And the LORD said unto Moses , Depart , and go up hence , thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt , unto the land which I sware unto Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , saying , Unto thy seed will I give it : 33 : 2 And I will send an angel before thee ; and I will drive out the Canaanite , the Amorite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite : 33 : 3 Unto a land flowing with milk and honey : for I will not go up in the midst of thee ; for thou art a stiffnecked people : lest I consume thee in the way .
34 : 11 Observe thou that which I command thee this day : behold , I drive out before thee the Amorite , and the Canaanite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Hivite , and the Jebusite .
14 : 30 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves , or of the young pigeons , such as he can get ; 14 : 31 Even such as he is able to get , the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , with the meat offering : and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD .
14 : 33 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying , 14 : 34 When ye be come into the land of Canaan , which I give to you for a possession , and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession ; 14 : 35 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest , saying , It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house : 14 : 36 Then the priest shall command that they empty the house , before the priest go into it to see the plague , that all that is in the house be not made unclean : and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house : 14 : 37 And he shall look on the plague , and , behold , if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes , greenish or reddish , which in sight are lower than the wall ; 14 : 38 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house , and shut up the house seven days : 14 : 39 And the priest shall come again the seventh day , and shall look : and , behold , if the plague be spread in the walls of the house ; 14 : 40 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is , and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city : 14 : 41 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about , and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place : 14 : 42 And they shall take other stones , and put them in the place of those stones ; and he shall take other morter , and shall plaister the house .
18 : 3 After the doings of the land of Egypt , wherein ye dwelt , shall ye not do : and after the doings of the land of Canaan , whither I bring you , shall ye not do : neither shall ye walk in their ordinances .
25 : 38 I am the LORD your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , to give you the land of Canaan , and to be your God .
13 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 13 : 2 Send thou men , that they may search the land of Canaan , which I give unto the children of Israel : of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man , every one a ruler among them .
13 : 17 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan , and said unto them , Get you up this way southward , and go up into the mountain : 13 : 18 And see the land , what it is , and the people that dwelleth therein , whether they be strong or weak , few or many ; 13 : 19 And what the land is that they dwell in , whether it be good or bad ; and what cities they be that they dwell in , whether in tents , or in strong holds ; 13 : 20 And what the land is , whether it be fat or lean , whether there be wood therein , or not .
13 : 29 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south : and the Hittites , and the Jebusites , and the Amorites , dwell in the mountains : and the Canaanites dwell by the sea , and by the coast of Jordan .
14 : 25 ( Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley .)
14 : 43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you , and ye shall fall by the sword : because ye are turned away from the LORD , therefore the LORD will not be with you .
14 : 45 Then the Amalekites came down , and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill , and smote them , and discomfited them , even unto Hormah .
21 : 1 And when king Arad the Canaanite , which dwelt in the south , heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies ; then he fought against Israel , and took some of them prisoners .
21 : 3 And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel , and delivered up the Canaanites ; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities : and he called the name of the place Hormah .
23 : 10 Who can count the dust of Jacob , and the number of the fourth part of Israel ?
26 : 19 The sons of Judah were Er and Onan : and Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan .
32 : 28 So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of Nun , and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel : 32 : 29 And Moses said unto them , If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan , every man armed to battle , before the LORD , and the land shall be subdued before you ; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession : 32 : 30 But if they will not pass over with you armed , they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan .
32 : 32 We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan , that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours .
33 : 40 And king Arad the Canaanite , which dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan , heard of the coming of the children of Israel .
33 : 50 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho , saying , 33 : 51 Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan ; 33 : 52 Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you , and destroy all their pictures , and destroy all their molten images , and quite pluck down all their high places : 33 : 53 And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land , and dwell therein : for I have given you the land to possess it .
34 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 34 : 2 Command the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye come into the land of Canaan ; ( this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance , even the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof :) 34 : 3 Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom , and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward : 34 : 4 And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim , and pass on to Zin : and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea , and shall go on to Hazaraddar , and pass on to Azmon : 34 : 5 And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt , and the goings out of it shall be at the sea .
34 : 29 These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan .
35 : 9 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 35 : 10 Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan ; 35 : 11 Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you ; that the slayer may flee thither , which killeth any person at unawares .
35 : 14 Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan , and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan , which shall be cities of refuge .
1 : 3 And it came to pass in the fortieth year , in the eleventh month , on the first day of the month , that Moses spake unto the children of Israel , according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them ; 1 : 4 After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites , which dwelt in Heshbon , and Og the king of Bashan , which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei : 1 : 5 On this side Jordan , in the land of Moab , began Moses to declare this law , saying , 1 : 6 The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb , saying , Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount : 1 : 7 Turn you , and take your journey , and go to the mount of the Amorites , and unto all the places nigh thereunto , in the plain , in the hills , and in the vale , and in the south , and by the sea side , to the land of the Canaanites , and unto Lebanon , unto the great river , the river Euphrates .
1 : 12 How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance , and your burden , and your strife ?
3 : 23 And I besought the LORD at that time , saying , 3 : 24 O Lord GOD , thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness , and thy mighty hand : for what God is there in heaven or in earth , that can do according to thy works , and according to thy might ?
7 : 1 When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it , and hath cast out many nations before thee , the Hittites , and the Girgashites , and the Amorites , and the Canaanites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , seven nations greater and mightier than thou ; 7 : 2 And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee ; thou shalt smite them , and utterly destroy them ; thou shalt make no covenant with them , nor shew mercy unto them : 7 : 3 Neither shalt thou make marriages with them ; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son , nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son .
7 : 17 If thou shalt say in thine heart , These nations are more than I ; how can I dispossess them ?
9 : 1 Hear , O Israel : Thou art to pass over Jordan this day , to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself , cities great and fenced up to heaven , 9 : 2 A people great and tall , the children of the Anakims , whom thou knowest , and of whom thou hast heard say , Who can stand before the children of Anak !
11 : 30 Are they not on the other side Jordan , by the way where the sun goeth down , in the land of the Canaanites , which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal , beside the plains of Moreh ?
20 : 16 But of the cities of these people , which the LORD thy God doth give thee for an inheritance , thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth : 20 : 17 But thou shalt utterly destroy them ; namely , the Hittites , and the Amorites , the Canaanites , and the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites ; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee : 20 : 18 That they teach you not to do after all their abominations , which they have done unto their gods ; so should ye sin against the LORD your God .
31 : 2 And he said unto them , I am an hundred and twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : also the LORD hath said unto me , Thou shalt not go over this Jordan .
32 : 39 See now that I , even I , am he , and there is no god with me : I kill , and I make alive ; I wound , and I heal : neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand .
32 : 48 And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day , saying , 32 : 49 Get thee up into this mountain Abarim , unto mount Nebo , which is in the land of Moab , that is over against Jericho ; and behold the land of Canaan , which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession : 32 : 50 And die in the mount whither thou goest up , and be gathered unto thy people ; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor , and was gathered unto his people : 32 : 51 Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh , in the wilderness of Zin ; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel .
3 : 10 And Joshua said , Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Hivites , and the Perizzites , and the Girgashites , and the Amorites , and the Jebusites .
5 : 1 And it came to pass , when all the kings of the Amorites , which were on the side of Jordan westward , and all the kings of the Canaanites , which were by the sea , heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel , until we were passed over , that their heart melted , neither was there spirit in them any more , because of the children of Israel .
5 : 12 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land ; neither had the children of Israel manna any more ; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year .
7 : 9 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it , and shall environ us round , and cut off our name from the earth : and what wilt thou do unto thy great name ?
9 : 1 And it came to pass , when all the kings which were on this side Jordan , in the hills , and in the valleys , and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon , the Hittite , and the Amorite , the Canaanite , the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite , heard thereof ; 9 : 2 That they gathered themselves together , to fight with Joshua and with Israel , with one accord .
11 : 1 And it came to pass , when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things , that he sent to Jobab king of Madon , and to the king of Shimron , and to the king of Achshaph , 11 : 2 And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains , and of the plains south of Chinneroth , and in the valley , and in the borders of Dor on the west , 11 : 3 And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west , and to the Amorite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Jebusite in the mountains , and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh .
12 : 7 And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west , from Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak , that goeth up to Seir ; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions ; 12 : 8 In the mountains , and in the valleys , and in the plains , and in the springs , and in the wilderness , and in the south country ; the Hittites , the Amorites , and the Canaanites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites : 12 : 9 The king of Jericho , one ; the king of Ai , which is beside Bethel , one ; 12 : 10 The king of Jerusalem , one ; the king of Hebron , one ; 12 : 11 The king of Jarmuth , one ; the king of Lachish , one ; 12 : 12 The king of Eglon , one ; the king of Gezer , one ; 12 : 13 The king of Debir , one ; the king of Geder , one ; 12 : 14 The king of Hormah , one ; the king of Arad , one ; 12 : 15 The king of Libnah , one ; the king of Adullam , one ; 12 : 16 The king of Makkedah , one ; the king of Bethel , one ; 12 : 17 The king of Tappuah , one ; the king of Hepher , one ; 12 : 18 The king of Aphek , one ; the king of Lasharon , one ; 12 : 19 The king of Madon , one ; the king of Hazor , one ; 12 : 20 The king of Shimronmeron , one ; the king of Achshaph , one ; 12 : 21 The king of Taanach , one ; the king of Megiddo , one ; 12 : 22 The king of Kedesh , one ; the king of Jokneam of Carmel , one ; 12 : 23 The king of Dor in the coast of Dor , one ; the king of the nations of Gilgal , one ; 12 : 24 The king of Tirzah , one : all the kings thirty and one .
13 : 2 This is the land that yet remaineth : all the borders of the Philistines , and all Geshuri , 13 : 3 From Sihor , which is before Egypt , even unto the borders of Ekron northward , which is counted to the Canaanite : five lords of the Philistines ; the Gazathites , and the Ashdothites , the Eshkalonites , the Gittites , and the Ekronites ; also the Avites : 13 : 4 From the south , all the land of the Canaanites , and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians unto Aphek , to the borders of the Amorites : 13 : 5 And the land of the Giblites , and all Lebanon , toward the sunrising , from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath .
14 : 1 And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan , which Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of Nun , and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel , distributed for inheritance to them .
16 : 10 And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer : but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day , and serve under tribute .
17 : 12 Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities ; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land .
17 : 13 Yet it came to pass , when the children of Israel were waxen strong , that they put the Canaanites to tribute , but did not utterly drive them out .
17 : 16 And the children of Joseph said , The hill is not enough for us : and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron , both they who are of Bethshean and her towns , and they who are of the valley of Jezreel .
17 : 17 And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph , even to Ephraim and to Manasseh , saying , Thou art a great people , and hast great power : thou shalt not have one lot only : 17 : 18 But the mountain shall be thine ; for it is a wood , and thou shalt cut it down : and the outgoings of it shall be thine : for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites , though they have iron chariots , and though they be strong .
21 : 1 Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto Eleazar the priest , and unto Joshua the son of Nun , and unto the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel ; 21 : 2 And they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan , saying , The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in , with the suburbs thereof for our cattle .
22 : 9 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned , and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan , to go unto the country of Gilead , to the land of their possession , whereof they were possessed , according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses .
22 : 10 And when they came unto the borders of Jordan , that are in the land of Canaan , the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan , a great altar to see to .
22 : 11 And the children of Israel heard say , Behold , the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan , in the borders of Jordan , at the passage of the children of Israel .
22 : 32 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , and the princes , returned from the children of Reuben , and from the children of Gad , out of the land of Gilead , unto the land of Canaan , to the children of Israel , and brought them word again .
24 : 3 And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood , and led him throughout all the land of Canaan , and multiplied his seed , and gave him Isaac .
24 : 11 And you went over Jordan , and came unto Jericho : and the men of Jericho fought against you , the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Girgashites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites ; and I delivered them into your hand .
1 : 1 Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass , that the children of Israel asked the LORD , saying , Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first , to fight against them ?
1 : 3 And Judah said unto Simeon his brother , Come up with me into my lot , that we may fight against the Canaanites ; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot .
1 : 4 And Judah went up ; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand : and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men .
1 : 5 And they found Adonibezek in Bezek : and they fought against him , and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites .
1 : 9 And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites , that dwelt in the mountain , and in the south , and in the valley .
1 : 10 And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron : ( now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba :) and they slew Sheshai , and Ahiman , and Talmai .
1 : 17 And Judah went with Simeon his brother , and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath , and utterly destroyed it .
1 : 27 Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns , nor Taanach and her towns , nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns , nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns , nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns : but the Canaanites would dwell in that land .
1 : 28 And it came to pass , when Israel was strong , that they put the Canaanites to tribute , and did not utterly drive them out .
1 : 29 Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer ; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them .
1 : 30 Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron , nor the inhabitants of Nahalol ; but the Canaanites dwelt among them , and became tributaries .
1 : 31 Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho , nor the inhabitants of Zidon , nor of Ahlab , nor of Achzib , nor of Helbah , nor of Aphik , nor of Rehob : 1 : 32 But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land : for they did not drive them out .
1 : 33 Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh , nor the inhabitants of Bethanath ; but he dwelt among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land : nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them .
3 : 1 Now these are the nations which the LORD left , to prove Israel by them , even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan ; 3 : 2 Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know , to teach them war , at the least such as before knew nothing thereof ; 3 : 3 Namely , five lords of the Philistines , and all the Canaanites , and the Sidonians , and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon , from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath .
3 : 5 And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites , Hittites , and Amorites , and Perizzites , and Hivites , and Jebusites : 3 : 6 And they took their daughters to be their wives , and gave their daughters to their sons , and served their gods .
4 : 2 And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan , that reigned in Hazor ; the captain of whose host was Sisera , which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles .
4 : 23 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel .
4 : 24 And the hand of the children of Israel prospered , and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan , until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan .
5 : 19 The kings came and fought , then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo ; they took no gain of money .
14 : 12 And Samson said unto them , I will now put forth a riddle unto you : if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast , and find it out , then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments : 14 : 13 But if ye cannot declare it me , then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments .
21 : 12 And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins , that had known no man by lying with any male : and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan .

16 : 2 And Samuel said , How can I go ?
16 : 17 And Saul said unto his servants , Provide me now a man that can play well , and bring him to me .
18 : 8 And Saul was very wroth , and the saying displeased him ; and he said , They have ascribed unto David ten thousands , and to me they have ascribed but thousands : and what can he have more but the kingdom ?
26 : 9 And David said to Abishai , Destroy him not : for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD ' s anointed , and be guiltless ?
28 : 2 And David said to Achish , Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do .
7 : 20 And what can David say more unto thee ?
12 : 22 And he said , While the child was yet alive , I fasted and wept : for I said , Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me , that the child may live ?
can I bring him back again ?
And the woman answered and said , As thy soul liveth , my lord the king , none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken : for thy servant Joab , he bade me , and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid : 14 : 20 To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing : and my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth .
15 : 36 Behold , they have there with them their two sons , Ahimaaz Zadok ' s son , and Jonathan Abiathar ' s son ; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear .
19 : 35 I am this day fourscore years old : and can I discern between good and evil ?
can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink ?
can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women ?
24 : 5 And they passed over Jordan , and pitched in Aroer , on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad , and toward Jazer : 24 : 6 Then they came to Gilead , and to the land of Tahtimhodshi ; and they came to Danjaan , and about to Zidon , 24 : 7 And came to the strong hold of Tyre , and to all the cities of the Hivites , and of the Canaanites : and they went out to the south of Judah , even to Beersheba .
5 : 6 Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon ; and my servants shall be with thy servants : and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint : for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians .
9 : 16 For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Gezer , and burnt it with fire , and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city , and given it for a present unto his daughter , Solomon ' s wife .
1 : 8 The sons of Ham ; Cush , and Mizraim , Put , and Canaan .
1 : 13 And Canaan begat Zidon his firstborn , and Heth , 1 : 14 The Jebusite also , and the Amorite , and the Girgashite , 1 : 15 And the Hivite , and the Arkite , and the Sinite , 1 : 16 And the Arvadite , and the Zemarite , and the Hamathite .
2 : 3 The sons of Judah ; Er , and Onan , and Shelah : which three were born unto him of the daughter of Shua the Canaanitess .
16 : 15 Be ye mindful always of his covenant ; the word which he commanded to a thousand generations ; 16 : 16 Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham , and of his oath unto Isaac ; 16 : 17 And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law , and to Israel for an everlasting covenant , 16 : 18 Saying , Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan , the lot of your inheritance ; 16 : 19 When ye were but few , even a few , and strangers in it .
17 : 18 What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant ?
1 : 10 Give me now wisdom and knowledge , that I may go out and come in before this people : for who can judge this thy people , that is so great ?
2 : 7 Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold , and in silver , and in brass , and in iron , and in purple , and crimson , and blue , and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem , whom David my father did provide .
2 : 8 Send me also cedar trees , fir trees , and algum trees , out of Lebanon : for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon ; and , behold , my servants shall be with thy servants , 2 : 9 Even to prepare me timber in abundance : for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderful great .
9 : 1 Now when these things were done , the princes came to me , saying , The people of Israel , and the priests , and the Levites , have not separated themselves from the people of the lands , doing according to their abominations , even of the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Jebusites , the Ammonites , the Moabites , the Egyptians , and the Amorites .
9 : 7 Thou art the LORD the God , who didst choose Abram , and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees , and gavest him the name of Abraham ; 9 : 8 And foundest his heart faithful before thee , and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Jebusites , and the Girgashites , to give it , I say , to his seed , and hast performed thy words ; for thou art righteous : 9 : 9 And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt , and heardest their cry by the Red sea ; 9 : 10 And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh , and on all his servants , and on all the people of his land : for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them .
9 : 24 So the children went in and possessed the land , and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land , the Canaanites , and gavest them into their hands , with their kings , and the people of the land , that they might do with them as they would .
So Esther arose , and stood before the king , 8 : 5 And said , If it please the king , and if I have favour in his sight , and the thing seem right before the king , and I be pleasing in his eyes , let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king ' s provinces : 8 : 6 For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people ?
or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred ?
3 : 20 Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery , and life unto the bitter in soul ; 3 : 21 Which long for death , but it cometh not ; and dig for it more than for hid treasures ; 3 : 22 Which rejoice exceedingly , and are glad , when they can find the grave ?
but who can withhold himself from speaking ?
6 : 6 Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt ?
8 : 11 Can the rush grow up without mire ?
can the flag grow without water ?
9 : 12 Behold , he taketh away , who can hinder him ?
10 : 7 Thou knowest that I am not wicked ; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand .
11 : 10 If he cut off , and shut up , or gather together , then who can hinder him ?
12 : 14 Behold , he breaketh down , and it cannot be built again : he shutteth up a man , and there can be no opening .
14 : 4 Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean ?
or with speeches wherewith he can do no good ?
22 : 1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said , 22 : 2 Can a man be profitable unto God , as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself ?
can he judge through the dark cloud ?
22 : 16 Which were cut down out of time , whose foundation was overflown with a flood : 22 : 17 Which said unto God , Depart from us : and what can the Almighty do for them ?
23 : 13 But he is in one mind , and who can turn him ?
25 : 4 How then can man be justified with God ?
or how can he be clean that is born of a woman ?
but the thunder of his power who can understand ?
34 : 29 When he giveth quietness , who then can make trouble ?
and when he hideth his face , who then can behold him ?
or who can say , Thou hast wrought iniquity ?
36 : 26 Behold , God is great , and we know him not , neither can the number of his years be searched out .
36 : 29 Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds , or the noise of his tabernacle ?
38 : 37 Who can number the clouds in wisdom ?
or who can stay the bottles of heaven , 38 : 38 When the dust groweth into hardness , and the clods cleave fast together ?
40 : 14 Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee .
40 : 19 He is the chief of the ways of God : he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him .
40 : 23 Behold , he drinketh up a river , and hasteth not : he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth .
41 : 13 Who can discover the face of his garment ?
or who can come to him with his double bridle ?
41 : 14 Who can open the doors of his face ?
41 : 16 One is so near to another , that no air can come between them .
42 : 1 Then Job answered the LORD , and said , 42 : 2 I know that thou canst do every thing , and that no thought can be withholden from thee .
11 : 3 If the foundations be destroyed , what can the righteous do ?
19 : 12 Who can understand his errors ?
22 : 29 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship : all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him : and none can keep alive his own soul .
40 : 5 Many , O LORD my God , are thy wonderful works which thou hast done , and thy thoughts which are to us - ward : they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee : if I would declare and speak of them , they are more than can be numbered .
49 : 7 None of them can by any means redeem his brother , nor give to God a ransom for him :
56 : 4 In God I will praise his word , in God I have put my trust ; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me .
56 : 11 In God have I put my trust : I will not be afraid what man can do unto me .
58 : 9 Before your pots can feel the thorns , he shall take them away as with a whirlwind , both living , and in his wrath .
78 : 19 Yea , they spake against God ; they said , Can God furnish a table in the wilderness ?
78 : 20 Behold , he smote the rock , that the waters gushed out , and the streams overflowed ; can he give bread also ?
can he provide flesh for his people ?
89 : 6 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD ?
who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD ?
105 : 11 Saying , Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan , the lot of your inheritance :
106 : 2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD ?
who can shew forth all his praise ?
106 : 38 And shed innocent blood , even the blood of their sons and of their daughters , whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan : and the land was polluted with blood .
118 : 6 The LORD is on my side ; I will not fear : what can man do unto me ?
135 : 11 Sihon king of the Amorites , and Og king of Bashan , and all the kingdoms of Canaan :
147 : 17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels : who can stand before his cold ?
6 : 27 Can a man take fire in his bosom , and his clothes not be burned ?
6 : 28 Can one go upon hot coals , and his feet not be burned ?
18 : 14 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity ; but a wounded spirit who can bear ?
20 : 6 Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness : but a faithful man who can find ?
20 : 9 Who can say , I have made my heart clean , I am pure from my sin ?
20 : 24 Man ' s goings are of the LORD ; how can a man then understand his own way ?
26 : 16 The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason .
31 : 10 Who can find a virtuous woman ?
2 : 12 And I turned myself to behold wisdom , and madness , and folly : for what can the man do that cometh after the king ?
2 : 25 For who can eat , or who else can hasten hereunto , more than I ?
3 : 11 He hath made every thing beautiful in his time : also he hath set the world in their heart , so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end .
3 : 14 I know that , whatsoever God doeth , it shall be for ever : nothing can be put to it , nor any thing taken from it : and God doeth it , that men should fear before him .
4 : 11 Again , if two lie together , then they have heat : but how can one be warm alone ?
for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun ?
7 : 13 Consider the work of God : for who can make that straight , which he hath made crooked ?
7 : 24 That which is far off , and exceeding deep , who can find it out ?
8 : 7 For he knoweth not that which shall be : for who can tell him when it shall be ?
10 : 14 A fool also is full of words : a man cannot tell what shall be ; and what shall be after him , who can tell him ?
8 : 7 Many waters cannot quench love , neither can the floods drown it : if a man would give all the substance of his house for love , it would utterly be contemned .
19 : 18 In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan , and swear to the LORD of hosts ; one shall be called , The city of destruction .
28 : 20 For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it : and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it .
38 : 18 For the grave cannot praise thee , death can not celebrate thee : they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth .
43 : 9 Let all the nations be gathered together , and let the people be assembled : who among them can declare this , and shew us former things ?
43 : 13 Yea , before the day was I am he ; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand : I will work , and who shall let it ?
46 : 7 They bear him upon the shoulder , they carry him , and set him in his place , and he standeth ; from his place shall he not remove : yea , one shall cry unto him , yet can he not answer , nor save him out of his trouble .
49 : 15 Can a woman forget her sucking child , that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb ?
56 : 11 Yea , they are greedy dogs which can never have enough , and they are shepherds that cannot understand : they all look to their own way , every one for his gain , from his quarter .
2 : 13 For my people have committed two evils ; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters , and hewed them out cisterns , broken cisterns , that can hold no water .
see thy way in the valley , know what thou hast done : thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways ; 2 : 24 A wild ass used to the wilderness , that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure ; in her occasion who can turn her away ?
let them arise , if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble : for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods , O Judah .
2 : 32 Can a maid forget her ornaments , or a bride her attire ?

4 : 34 And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven , and mine understanding returned unto me , and I blessed the most High , and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever , whose dominion is an everlasting dominion , and his kingdom is from generation to generation : 4 : 35 And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing : and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven , and among the inhabitants of the earth : and none can stay his hand , or say unto him , What doest thou ?

3 : 1 There was a man of the Pharisees , named Nicodemus , a ruler of the Jews : 3 : 2 The same came to Jesus by night , and said unto him , Rabbi , we know that thou art a teacher come from God : for no man can do these miracles that thou doest , except God be with him .

8 : 7 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God : for it is not subject to the law of God , neither indeed can be .
If God be for us , who can be against us ?
2 : 14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God : for they are foolishness unto him : neither can he know them , because they are spiritually discerned .
3 : 11 For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid , which is Jesus Christ .
12 : 3 Wherefore I give you to understand , that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed : and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord , but by the Holy Ghost .
13 : 8 For we can do nothing against the truth , but for the truth .
4 : 13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me .

6 : 13 I give thee charge in the sight of God , who quickeneth all things , and before Christ Jesus , who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession ; 6 : 14 That thou keep this commandment without spot , unrebukable , until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ : 6 : 15 Which in his times he shall shew , who is the blessed and only Potentate , the King of kings , and Lord of lords ; 6 : 16 Who only hath immortality , dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto ; whom no man hath seen , nor can see : to whom be honour and power everlasting .
2 : 17 And their word will eat as doth a canker : of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus ; 2 : 18 Who concerning the truth have erred , saying that the resurrection is past already ; and overthrow the faith of some .
5 : 1 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God , that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins : 5 : 2 Who can have compassion on the ignorant , and on them that are out of the way ; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity .
10 : 1 For the law having a shadow of good things to come , and not the very image of the things , can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect .
10 : 11 And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins : 10 : 12 But this man , after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever , sat down on the right hand of God ; 10 : 13 From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool .
can faith save him ?

3 : 7 And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write ; These things saith he that is holy , he that is true , he that hath the key of David , he that openeth , and no man shutteth ; and shutteth , and no man openeth ; 3 : 8 I know thy works : behold , I have set before thee an open door , and no man can shut it : for thou hast a little strength , and hast kept my word , and hast not denied my name .
9 : 20 And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands , that they should not worship devils , and idols of gold , and silver , and brass , and stone , and of wood : which neither can see , nor hear , nor walk : 9 : 21 Neither repented they of their murders , nor of their sorceries , nor of their fornication , nor of their thefts .
Till the little ones , weary , No more can be merry : The sun does descend , And our sports have an end .
I ' ll shade him from the heat till he can bear To lean in joy upon our Father ' s knee ; And then I ' ll stand and stroke his silver hair , And be like him , and he will then love me .
Sweet babe , in thy face Holy image I can trace ; Sweet babe , once like thee Thy Maker lay , and wept for me :
" And now beside thee , bleating lamb , I can lie down and sleep , Or think on Him who bore thy name , Graze after thee , and weep .
Can I see another ' s woe , And not be in sorrow too ?
Can I see another ' s grief , And not seek for kind relief ?

Can a mother sit and hear An infant groan , an infant fear ?
never can it be !
Never , never can it be !
And can He who smiles on all Hear the wren with sorrows small , Hear the small bird ' s grief and care , Hear the woes that infants bear --
never can it be !
Never , never can it be !
Can delight , Chained in night , The virgins of youth and morning bear ?
Can it be a song of joy ?
Where can Lyca sleep ?
How can Lyca sleep If her mother weep ?
What can it mean ?
Besides , I can tell where I am used well ; The poor parsons with wind like a blown bladder swell .
" And , father , how can I love you Or any of my brothers more ?
Ah then at times I drooping sit , And spend many an anxious hour ; Nor in my book can I take delight , Nor sit in learning ' s bower , Worn through with the dreary shower .
How can the bird that is born for joy Sit in a cage and sing ?
How can a child , when fears annoy , But droop his tender wing , And forget his youthful spring ?
Or wilt thou go ask the Mole : Can Wisdom be put in a silver rod ?
I see thee like an infant wrapped in the Lillys leaf ; Ah weep not little voice , thou can ' st not speak , but thou can ' st weep : Is this a Worm ?
And says ; Thou mother of my children , I have loved thee And I have given thee a crown that none can take away .

It was the story of _Pilgrim ' s Progress_ ; if you have never heard it , you must be sure to read it as soon as you can read well enough to understand the old - fashioned words .
How can I learn to rule myself , To be the child I should , Honest and brave , nor ever tire Of trying to be good ?
How can I keep a sunny soul To shine along life ' s way ?
How can I tune my little heart To sweetly sing all day ?
And can you think how happy the baby ' s mother was ?
The shoemaker and his wife looked at each other , and said , " How can we thank the little elves who have made us happy and prosperous ?"

Then I can understand in a jiffy .
" Can ' t you see that the door shut me in ?"

The two front corners had canariensis in them .
Canariensis is a pretty creeper with golden blossoms , very dainty and bright .
All these lovely flowers used to grow in our grandmothers ' gardens , and if you don ' t know what they look like , I hope you can find out next summer .

Buster learned a long time ago that a fisherman must be patient unless , like Little Joe Otter , he is just as much at home in the water as the fish themselves , and can swim fast enough to catch them by chasing them .
Now Buster Bear may be big and clumsy looking , but there isn ' t anything that can move much quicker than one of those big paws of his when he wants it to .
" Can you tell me the difference between the fish that you haven ' t caught and the foolish green flies that I haven ' t caught ?"
" I believe ," said Little Joe as he wiped tears of laughter from his eyes , " that Grandfather Frog is right , and that the best thing I can do is to make friends with Buster Bear .
Billy sometimes catches more fish than he can eat , but then he usually hides them .
But there is only one thing that can make the hair on the head of Farmer Brown ' s boy rise , and as it isn ' t anger , of course it must be fear .
I don ' t believe anybody can be smarter than Buster Bear ."
" We can tell better how great it is when we hear what it is ," replied Grandfather Frog testily .
Now I ' ve got a plan by which we can see for ourselves if he really is afraid of Buster Bear ."
If you meet me at the Big Hickory - tree at sun - up to - morrow morning , and get everybody else to come that you can , perhaps I will tell you ."
It is a very simple plan , and if you will all hide where you can watch , you will be able to see for yourselves if Little Joe Otter is right .
Big as he is , he can walk without making the teeniest , weeniest sound .
He ran just as Peter Rabbit runs when he has got to reach the dear Old Briar - patch before Reddy Fox can catch him , which , you know , is as fast as he can run .
Of course Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay , who , because they can fly , have nothing to fear from Buster , and who always delight in making other people uncomfortable , never let a chance go by to tell Buster and everybody else within hearing what they thought of him .
You see , he knows that Shadow can go wherever he can go .
That is the way that a habit which isn ' t bad in itself can become bad when it is carried too far .
I can eat all I want and get back to the Green Forest before there is any danger that Farmer Brown ' s boy or any one else I ' m afraid of will see me .
" If I whistle ," thought he , " everybody will know just where I am , and will keep out of sight , and I never can get acquainted with folks if they keep out of sight ."
Now if there is any one thing that Buster Bear had rather have above another , it is all the berries he can eat , unless it be honey .
Nothing can quite equal honey in Buster ' s mind .
When things go wrong in spite of you To smile ' s the best thing you can do -- To smile and say , " I ' m mighty glad They are no worse ; they ' re not so bad !"
I can pick berries some other day ."
' Well , I ' ll eat it ,' said Alice , ' and if it makes me grow larger , I can reach the key ; and if it makes me grow smaller , I can creep under the door ; so either way I ' ll get into the garden , and I don ' t care which happens !'
I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you : you must manage the best way you can ;-- but I must be kind to them ,' thought Alice , ' or perhaps they won ' t walk the way I want to go !
I almost think I can remember feeling a little different .
' I ' m sure I ' m not Ada ,' she said , ' for her hair goes in such long ringlets , and mine doesn ' t go in ringlets at all ; and I ' m sure I can ' t be Mabel , for I know all sorts of things , and she , oh !
' How CAN I have done that ?'
Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea , ' and in that case I can go back by railway ,' she said to herself .
Everything is so out - of - the - way down here , that I should think very likely it can talk : at any rate , there ' s no harm in trying .'
And it ' ll fetch things when you throw them , and it ' ll sit up and beg for its dinner , and all sorts of things -- I can ' t remember half of them -- and it belongs to a farmer , you know , and he says it ' s so useful , it ' s worth a hundred pounds !
And she ' s such a capital one for catching mice you can ' t think !
Where CAN I have dropped them , I wonder ?'
But I ' d better take him his fan and gloves -- that is , if I can find them .'
She hastily put down the bottle , saying to herself ' That ' s quite enough -- I hope I shan ' t grow any more -- As it is , I can ' t get out at the door -- I do wish I hadn ' t drunk quite so much !'
Still she went on growing , and , as a last resource , she put one arm out of the window , and one foot up the chimney , and said to herself ' Now I can do no more , whatever happens .
I do wonder what CAN have happened to me !
' How can you learn lessons in here ?
I wouldn ' t be in Bill ' s place for a good deal : this fireplace is narrow , to be sure ; but I THINK I can kick a little !'
' If I eat one of these cakes ,' she thought , ' it ' s sure to make SOME change in my size ; and as it can ' t possibly make me larger , it must make me smaller , I suppose .'
' I can ' t explain MYSELF , I ' m afraid , sir ' said Alice , ' because I ' m not myself , you see .'
' I ' m afraid I can ' t put it more clearly ,' Alice replied very politely , ' for I can ' t understand it myself to begin with ; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing .'
' I ' m afraid I am , sir ,' said Alice ; ' I can ' t remember things as I used -- and I don ' t keep the same size for ten minutes together !'
' Can ' t remember WHAT things ?'
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff ?
' What CAN all that green stuff be ?'
And oh , my poor hands , how is it I can ' t see you ?'
' I can see you ' re trying to invent something !'
' I don ' t believe it ,' said the Pigeon ; ' but if they do , why then they ' re a kind of serpent , that ' s all I can say .'
' But perhaps he can ' t help it ,' she said to herself ; ' his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head .
' They all can ,' said the Duchess ; ' and most of ' em do .'
' I speak severely to my boy , I beat him when he sneezes ; For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases !'
' Oh , you can ' t help that ,' said the Cat : ' we ' re all mad here .
' I ' m glad they ' ve begun asking riddles .-- I believe I can guess that ,' she added aloud .
' Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it ?'
' I ' ve had nothing yet ,' Alice replied in an offended tone , ' so I can ' t take more .'
' You mean you can ' t take LESS ,' said the Hatter : ' it ' s very easy to take MORE than nothing .'
and the Dormouse sulkily remarked , ' If you can ' t be civil , you ' d better finish the story for yourself .'
' You can draw water out of a water - well ,' said the Hatter ; ' so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle - well -- eh , stupid ?'
' Can you play croquet ?'
' I don ' t think they play at all fairly ,' Alice began , in rather a complaining tone , ' and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can ' t hear oneself speak -- and they don ' t seem to have any rules in particular ; at least , if there are , nobody attends to them -- and you ' ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive ; for instance , there ' s the arch I ' ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground -- and I should have croqueted the Queen ' s hedgehog just now , only it ran away when it saw mine coming !'
' You can ' t think how glad I am to see you again , you dear old thing !'
I can ' t tell you just now what the moral of that is , but I shall remember it in a bit .'
' Everything ' s got a moral , if only you can find it .'
' I think I should understand that better ,' Alice said very politely , ' if I had it written down : but I can ' t quite follow it as you say it .'
Alice thought to herself , ' I don ' t see how he can EVEN finish , if he doesn ' t begin .'
' Well , I can ' t show it you myself ,' the Mock Turtle said : ' I ' m too stiff .
' You may not have lived much under the sea --' (' I haven ' t ,' said Alice )--' and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster --' ( Alice began to say ' I once tasted --' but checked herself hastily , and said ' No , never ') '-- so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is !'
'-- as far out to sea as you can --'
' We can do without lobsters , you know .
" You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us , with the lobsters , out to sea !"
' I can tell you more than that , if you like ,' said the Gryphon .
' It ' s all about as curious as it can be ,' said the Gryphon .
' She can ' t explain it ,' said the Gryphon hastily .
' They can ' t have anything to put down yet , before the trial ' s begun .'
' I can hardly breathe .'
' I can ' t help it ,' said Alice very meekly : ' I ' m growing .'
' That I can ' t remember ,' said the Hatter .
' I can ' t go no lower ,' said the Hatter : ' I ' m on the floor , as it is .'
' Please your Majesty ,' said the Knave , ' I didn ' t write it , and they can ' t prove I did : there ' s no name signed at the end .'
' If any one of them can explain it ,' said Alice , ( she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn ' t a bit afraid of interrupting him ,) ' I ' ll give him sixpence .
-- SAID I COULD NOT SWIM --" you can ' t swim , can you ?'
' Nothing can be clearer than THAT .
The imbecility of your traditions can be quite finally exhibited to anybody with mere ordinary knowledge of the world , the same kind of knowledge which teaches us not to sit in draughts or not to encourage friendliness in impecunious people .
" What can it be ?
" I was telling you just now , Michael , that I can prove the best part of the rationalist case and the Christian humbug from any symbol you liked to give me , from any instance I came across .
" Can you be anything else when you plaster your own house with that God - defying filth ?
" I tell you once and for all ," cried Mr . Cumberland Vane , rapping his knuckles angrily on the table , " I tell you , once and for all , my man , that I will not have you turning on any religious rant or cant here .
" Might I suggest ," he said , " That I , your worship , can settle to some extent this absurd matter myself .
" Why , you moonstruck scarecrow of superstition , do you think your dirty saints are the only people who can die ?
Words have passed between Mr . Turnbull and myself on a grave and invaluable matter , which can only be atoned for by fighting .
You can ' t be angry with bad men .
" Under those conditions ," continued Turnbull , his voice coming through the hole with a slight note of trepidation very unusual with him , " I have a suggestion to make , if that can be called a suggestion , which has probably occurred to you as readily as to me .
Hence the complete picture they give of life is of necessity fallacious ; they can only represent what is unusual .
There fell upon both of them , but upon Turnbull more than the other , because he know more what the scene signified , that quite indescribable sense as of a sublime and passionate and heart - moving futility , which is never evoked by deserts or dead men or men neglected and barbarous , which can only be invoked by the sight of the enormous genius of man applied to anything other than the best .
" And still we ask if God or man Can loosen thee Lazarus ; Bid thee rise up republican , And save thyself and all of us .
But no disciple ' s tongue can say If thou can ' st take our sins away ."
And yet you ask me to trust my temperament , my own temperament , which can be turned upside down by two bottles of claret or an attack of the jaundice .
" There is a part of me which is divine ," he answered , " a part that can be trusted , but there are also affections which are entirely animal and idle ."
" Can you keep this up ?"
We must put it off if we can ."
" Who the devil can that be ?"
" Don ' t you be afraid ," he added , " he can still see us ."
" Do you know ," he said , " I think he can see us better this way .
Here you can fall back on that naked and awful arbitration which is the only thing that balances the stars -- a still , continuous violence .
" I can see it from here .
I can see the whitewashed walls of some cottages and a kind of corner of the church .
It is not merely that I do not believe that nature can guide us .
I mean that nobody can discover what the original nature of things would have been if things had not interfered with it .
If the natural does not exist the supernatural obviously can ' t ."
" One can ' t talk of this kind of thing under a ceiling at all .
I can understand your disbelieving in it , but why disbelieve in a part of it ?
You cannot prove that God is better than a man ; nor can you prove that a man is better than a horse .
He had met many typical modern figures under circumstances which were sharply symbolic ; and , moreover , he had absorbed the main modern atmosphere from the mere presence and chance phrases of Turnbull , as such atmospheres can always be absorbed from the presence and the phrases of any man of great mental vitality .
But there is one thing Free - thought can never be by any possibility -- Free - thought can never be progressive .
It can never be progressive because it will accept nothing from the past ; it begins every time again from the beginning ; and it goes every time in a different direction .
Who can discuss whether Emerson was a better optimist than Schopenhauer was pessimist ?
They may be progressing uphill and down ; they may be growing steadily better or steadily worse ; but they have steadily increased in certain definable matters ; they have steadily advanced in a certain definable direction ; they are the only two things , it seems , that ever _can_ progress .
" With this enormous difference ," said Turnbull , " that however elaborate be the calculations of physical science , their net result can be tested .
Still I can see the electric light .
The Church is the only thing on earth that can perpetuate a type of virtue and make it something more than a fashion .
But can you stand still here in this meadow and _be_ an English gentleman of Elizabeth ?
The human race has always admired the Catholic virtues , however little it can practise them ; and oddly enough it has admired most those of them that the modern world most sharply disputes .
Your quarrel can only be , your quarrel really only is , that Catholicism has _achieved_ an ideal of virginity ; that it is no longer a mere piece of floating poetry .
Every man feels the need of some element of purity in sex ; perhaps they can only typify purity as the absence of sex .
You will laugh if I suggest that we may have made in Fleet Street an atmosphere in which a man can be so passionate as Sir Lancelot and as pure as Sir Galahad .
" I can drive the car ," said the young woman in the fur cap with stony practicability .
" What can they mean ?"
" It won ' t do , you know ," she said ; " you can ' t find out the truth in that way .
" The time ' s gone by for all that ," she went on ; " you can ' t find out the real thing like that -- if there is really anything to find ----" and she sighed rather drearily ; for , like many of the women of our wealthy class , she was old and broken in thought , though young and clean enough in her emotions .
" You can leave me here ," she said , quite casually , as if they had met five minutes before .
" Now I come to think of it , I can ' t imagine ."
Then , after a pause , as she stared with a rising colour at the glittering sea , she said : " It can ' t be described , and yet I am trying to describe it .
Somehow one can never really manage to be an atheist ."
But the honour of this earth has just this about it , that it can make a man ' s heart like iron .
he cried ; " I can ' t help it -- fair fighting is more even than promises .
Among the implements of their first outfit the brandy alone had remained to him , and he gave it to his freezing companion in quantities which greatly alarmed that temperate Londoner ; but MacIan came from the cold seas and mists where a man can drink a tumbler of raw whisky in a boat without it making him wink .
He had a genius ( if one can even use so wild a word in connexion with so tame a person ) a genius for saying the conventional thing on every conceivable subject ; or rather what we in England would call the conventional thing .
Convention implies cant or affectation , and he had not the faintest smell of either .
She left upon ordinary people the impression -- the somewhat irritating impression -- produced by such a person ; it can only be described as the sense of strong water being perpetually poured into some abyss .
" I would do anything but that for you ," he said ; " but no man can be called less than a man ."
But when people dine with my father and say that fighting a duel is mere murder -- of course I can see that is not just .
I can ' t stand this !"
" There will be another mass in a matter of eight hours ," said Madeleine , with a sort of business eagerness and energy , " and you can do it then before the fighting .
" What can it all mean ?"
" Oh , I will say anything that can madden you !"
Can ' t drink beer myself .
" If you want to hurry you should take a yacht , and if "-- he said , with a burst of rationality , like one leaping to a further point in logic --" if you want a yacht -- you can have mine ."
" Left side of harbour -- called _Gibson Girl_ -- can ' t think why , old fellow , I never lent it you before ."
Evan ' s mind went through a crisis of instantaneous casuistry , in which it may be that he decided wrongly ; but about how he decided his biographer can profess no doubt .
The presence of the god or fairy can only be deduced from the fact that they never definitely ran into anything , either a boat , a rock , a quicksand , or a man - of - war .
" What can it be ?"
" I didn ' t know there were any Atlantic islands so far beyond the Scillies -- Good Lord , it can ' t be Madeira , yet ?"
They did not even explore the island ; for MacIan was partly concerned in prayer and Turnbull entirely concerned with tobacco ; and both these forms of inspiration can be enjoyed by the secluded and even the sedentary .
" Lord love a duck ," said he , " can it be Jamaica ?"
Then he said : " The best place we can go to is to bed .
If we can get some sleep in this wood , now everyone has cleared out of it , it will be worth a handicap of two hundred yards tomorrow ."
They had all the advantages that invisibility and silence can add to speed .
As it thinned yet farther they saw that it was only flowers ; but flowers in such insolent mass and magnificence as can seldom be seen out of the tropics .
" Can I do anything for you ?"
" You can extend to us your pardon ," he said , for he also came of a whole race of gentlemen -- of gentlemen without shirts to their backs .
" We are fighting about God ; there can be nothing so important as that ."
" I can settle the whole matter .
" Yes , you and I are both seconds -- and these two gentlemen can obviously fight in front of us .
He looked across at MacIan and said : " Oh , I can ' t stand this !"
" Can ' t stand what ?"
replied Turnbull ; " one can ' t use uncivil expressions even to a -- deity .
Turnbull ' s eyes did not move , but he realized that the man in the panama hat had lost all his ease of a landed proprietor and had withdrawn to a distance of thirty yards , where he stood glaring with all the contraction of fear and hatred that can stiffen a cat .
A god can be humble , a devil can only be humbled ."
He put his arm in mine and whispered in my ear , as if it were the apocalypse : ' Never trust a God that you can ' t improve on .'"
" What can he have meant ?"
" Obviously one should not trust any God that one can improve on ."
Even in a lunatic asylum there can ' t be anybody who , having thought about the matter , thinks that a triangle has not got three sides .
" But what can it matter ?"
" He can ' t keep us in the asylum .
" If you really want to put anything before me , I can give you a few moments in my consulting - room ."
" I can understand that you were startled ."
" Can we let ourselves out , then ?"
MacIan took one stride to the table , leant across it , and said : " We can ' t stop here , we ' re not mad people !"
" But you _can ' t_ think us mad ," thundered MacIan .
" But you can ' t shut a man up on your mere impressions without documents or certificates or anything ?"
" No man by will or wit ," answered Turnbull , " can get out of this garden ; and yet we got into it merely by jumping over a garden wall .
" I suppose you can take me to the war ," he said , and the silent silver figure only bowed its head again .
To say that it rose to the stars is no mere metaphor , for the sky had cleared to that occasional and astonishing transparency in which one can see plainly both stars and moon .
They can be orderly , but they cannot be equal ."
But when the stranger silently indicated the rope that led to the machine , he found himself pausing and saying : " I can ' t leave MacIan behind in this den ."
There is only one pleasure the angels can possibly have in flying , and that is , that they do not know whether they are on their head or their heels ."
" Dr . Hertz has convinced everybody ," said Turnbull ' s cicerone in a smooth voice , " that nothing can really be done with the real slums .
Can you , as a free - thinker , find any fault in that ?"
" You can see the head of the asylum if you particularly want to ."
A strong gun can conquer a strong elephant , but a wounded elephant can easily conquer a broken gun .
Thus the Prussian monarchy in the eighteenth century , or now , can make a strong army merely by making the men afraid .
Even now I ' ve got it out I can ' t discover what it was for .
" But where can the door of it be ?"
The lines of his face were so deep and complex that one could see five or ten different faces besides the real one , as one can see them in an elaborate wall - paper .
" Squares very good ; I have a nice long holiday , and can count them .
" Can ' t we do anything for you ?"
Can I help you ?"
" No , I don ' t think you can , sir ," said Turnbull with rough pathos ; " I am glad you are contented at least ."
They can be let out of their cell today , because today the whole world has become their cell .
" Well , I don ' t see that it can do any harm to tell you know ," he said .
" This can ' t go on ," he said , positively .
But to see things -- to see them walking solid in the sun -- things that can ' t be there -- real mystics never do that , Turnbull ."
" I saw her walk behind those blessed trees against that holy sky of gold as plain as I can see her whenever I shut my eyes .
" Oh , you can see my certificate if you like ," she replied with some hauteur .
" You can see it on my certificate of lunacy ."
" Oh , I can see you can ' t have it on you at the moment ," said Mr . Wilkinson with much intellectual magnanimity .
Turnbull stamped his foot on the gravel path , and called out : " Oh , I can ' t stand this .
I want to know what all this can possibly mean ."
What can it mean -- meeting all these old people again ?
" I can ' t see it ," said Evan ; " it is too large and plain ."
Then after a silence he said : " I can ' t see it -- and yet I will try to describe it .
cried Turnbull to himself , " if _he_ is in the asylum , there can ' t be anyone outside ."
" Oh , who can have done it ?
How can it have happened ?"
Then advancing to the fringe of the fire he called out on chance to the invisible singer : " Can you come out ?

He pays his rent to the tick ; he is practically a teetotaller ; he is tirelessly kind with the younger children , and can keep them amused for a day on end ; and , last and most urgent of all , he has made himself equally popular with the eldest daughter , who is ready to go to church with him tomorrow ."

" It can never be utterly stamped out ," Muscari answered ; " because armed revolt is a recreation natural to southerners .

" It ' s exactly like Hirsch ' s writing , and nobody can point out any mistake in it .
After that we really can ' t support Dubosc if his revelation is a mare ' s nest ."
It ' s manifestly absurd to say that Hirsch can have made a mistake about a paper that nobody knew of but himself ; or can have tried to help a foreign thief by telling him to fumble in the wrong drawer .
" I can ' t conceive ," said Brown ; " I don ' t understand this Hirsch affair at all .
That the direction about the drawer , the colour of ink , the colour of envelope , should none of them be right by accident , that can ' t be a coincidence .
" The only thing I can think of .... Well , I never understood that Dreyfus case .

The Captain ' s hand hesitated and dropped ; and the other added with the same icy candour : " If I find I haven ' t the nerve to do it with that dagger I can do it in a month with drink ."
" Looks a cannibal sort of chap , don ' t he ?"

" Will you understand my motives ," asked Father Brown quietly , " if I say you have done all you can to hurt ?"
As far as my words on oath can go , you might either of you have done it .
In those extraordinary circumstances the Press was paralysed into probity and accuracy ; and the rest of this somewhat singular business can practically be recorded from reports of Bruno ' s trial .
" And can you tell us why ," he asked , " you should know your own figure in a looking - glass , when two such distinguished men don ' t ?"

Equally elegant and more miscellaneous and large - hearted in social outlook was Last - Trick ' s show the year previous , the popular Cannibal Crush Lunch , at which the confections handed round were sarcastically moulded in the forms of human arms and legs , and during which more than one of our gayest mental gymnasts was heard offering to eat his partner .
" Well , the literary style is somewhat improved ," admitted the priest cheerfully , " but still I don ' t see what I can do for you .
Now , in my opinion , that machine can ' t lie ."
" No machine can lie ," said Father Brown ; " nor can it tell the truth ."
" Criminals also can be as cool as cucumbers ," said Brown with a smile .
He turned to me and began to say in a low voice : ` Oh , I can ' t stick this any more .
I don ' t think they can kill Drugger Davis on that old vague story of the poison ; and as for the convict who killed the warder , I suppose it ' s obvious that you haven ' t got him .
Can ' t you see the whole character is different , in good and evil ?
" But you can ' t be so mad as to say ," said Greywood Usher , very white , " that Lord Falconroy was Drugger Davis ."
He went down there "-- and he jerked his thumb over his shoulder in one of his undistinguished gestures -- " and can ' t have passed three lamp - posts yet .

I could never describe my father to you ; the nearest I can say is that he was very like a Roman coin himself .
I ' m not like my brother Arthur ; I can ' t help enjoying enjoyment .
I think a man as clever as you can guess the sort of thing that would begin to relieve the monotony for an unruly girl of seventeen placed in such a position .
But I am so rattled with more dreadful things that I can hardly read my own feeling ; and don ' t know whether I despise it now as a flirtation or bear it as a broken heart .

" I went up the steep street to my own house with my head in a whirl ; it had not begun to clear when I came to the doorstep , on which I found a milk - can -- and the man with the twisted nose .
The milk - can told me the servants were all out ; for , of course , Arthur , browsing about in his brown dressing - gown in a brown study , would not hear or answer a bell .
He stood quite still , with his face towards me ; and I can ' t tell you how horrid he looked among the tulips and all those tall , gaudy , almost hothouse - looking flowers .

because it would mean the crack of doom for me , and if you take it I shall take off my wig .... Why , you pitiful plucked fowl , anyone can see your bare head .
" I can quite understand that it ' s nicer to cover them with hair than with brass plates or leather flaps .
I suppose I can be prosecuted for assault , but I am very glad I did it .
Then the silence was snapped by the librarian exclaiming : " What can it mean ?
DEAR FINN ,-- You must be mad ; we can ' t touch this .
And how can he write about Normans if the man ' s only a solicitor ?
No one can calculate the turns of mood in convalescence : but Father Brown ' s depression must have had a great deal to do with his mere unfamiliarity with the sea .
The story goes that the lady of Sir Peter Pendragon built it in this place and to this height , because from the top you can just see the corner where vessels turn into the river mouth ; and she wished to be the first to see her husband ' s ship , as he sailed home from the Spanish Main ."
But it is perfectly true that this tower has been burnt down two or three times ; and the family can ' t be called lucky , for more than two , I think , of the Admiral ' s near kin have perished by shipwreck ; and one at least , to my own knowledge , on practically the same spot where Sir Peter threw the Spaniard overboard ."
" No ," it said ; " I ' ve really got to cut down this fence somehow ; it ' s spoiling all the plants , and no one else here can do it .
So would you if your only pleasure was in cruising about to find some new Cannibal Islands , and you had to stick on this muddy little rockery in a sort of rustic pond .
The Admiral lifted the hairless arches over his eyes and exclaimed : " Well , I don ' t know where you got it , but the truth is I can ' t stand the fellow , though I ' ve no excuse for discharging a family servant .
" In that case ," he said , " there can ' t be any objection to my sleeping in your delightful summer - house ."
They followed him , laughing and half remonstrating ; but he replied with the utmost solemnity , explaining to them , in a maddening little sermon , that one can always find some small occupation that is helpful to others .
" But you can ' t mean --"
" I suppose it can ' t spread to the house ."
Flambeau turned electrified eyes upon his friend , but Fanshaw only said rather absently : " Well , nobody can be killed , anyhow ."
" You can do no more , I fear ," said Brown in a voice cold with pain .
" Can ' t you put it simply in words of one syllable ?"
I have no staff at present , but I can get you anything simple myself ."
" My waiters are all Italians , you see , and I thought it only fair they should see their countryman beat the black , if he really can do it .
" I ' m afraid we can ' t wait to trouble your hospitality seriously ," said Father Brown .
As has been said , the hotel - keeper can be proved to have told the precise truth .
" Well ," said Flambeau , " I never murdered anyone , even in my criminal days , but I can almost sympathize with anyone doing it in such a dreary place .
I can fancy a morbid man feeling he must kill his rival in the solitude and irony of such a scene .
" I think we know all that this can tell us , but you shall look at it to see if I ' m right .
That negro who has just swaggered out is one of the most dangerous men on earth , for he has the brains of a European , with the instincts of a cannibal .
He doesn ' t know I know it , nor , for the matter of that , that I can ' t prove it ."
The more a man feels lonely the less he can be sure he is alone .
It ' s Sunday , and we can ' t send for vinegar and all that in the town ; and you Indian gentlemen can ' t enjoy what you call a dinner without a lot of hot things .
I don ' t believe you men can manage alone ."
" Oh yes , we can , my dear ," said the Major , looking at her very amiably .
" Putnam is an old soldier , and has been in Mexico and Australia , and the Cannibal Islands for all I know ."
" I hope it was not in the Cannibal Islands ," said Brown , " that he learnt the art of cookery ."
" He can ' t have been at the dustbin ," he muttered .
I can ' t eat it , but I ' ll mix it like an angel !
And as for vinegar , can any soldiers forget that solitary soldier , who , when the sun was darkened --"
And there is only one kind of club that can be thrown out of a window , turn in mid - air and come back to the window next to it : the Australian boomerang .
" I don ' t think it can go on without a smash ," said the young man with red hair , getting up and shaking himself .
" Yes ," answered Dalroy ; " but even a man of grand intellectual powers can ' t be such a blighted fool as all that .
For we human beings are used to inappropriate things ; we are accustomed to the clatter of the incongruous ; it is a tune to which we can go to sleep .
Anybody can be wicked -- as wicked as he chooses .
We can direct our moral wills ; but we can ' t generally change our instinctive tastes and ways of doing things .
" There were finger - prints on that sword ; finger - prints can be detected quite a time after they are made if they ' re on some polished surface like glass or steel .
" Why , what can you mean ?"
" Look here -- I say -- can I make your husband hear if I go to the house ?"
" I can ' t analyse myself well ," went on Boulnois ; " but sitting in that chair with that story I was as happy as a schoolboy on a half - holiday .
It was security , eternity -- I can ' t convey it ... the cigars were within reach ... the matches were within reach ... the Thumb had four more appearances to ... it was not only a peace , but a plenitude .
" Died ," repeated Flambeau , " and that ' s about as much as we can say .
It was carried out , with extraordinary thoroughness and severity , by very well - organized officials over a small and familiar area , and , so far as human strength and science can be absolutely certain of anything , Prince Otto was absolutely certain that nobody could introduce so much as a toy pistol into Heiligwaldenstein ."
" Human science can never be quite certain of things like that ," said Father Brown , still looking at the red budding of the branches over his head , " if only because of the difficulty about definition and connotation .
And the fact is we can ' t .
All the same , however romantic you are , you can ' t imagine a big bullet into a man ' s jaw or brain without using a gun or pistol .
He tried again and again , and it was impossible ; the men who had knotted that gag knew the difference between what a man can do with his hands in front of him and what he can do with his hands behind his head .
But we can know , I fancy , that this Hedwig was a heroine , and deserved to marry a man who became something of a hero .
Between us , by the peace of God , such truth can now be told ; Yea , there is strength in striking root and good in growing old .
He put the old cant of the lawlessness of art and the art of lawlessness with a certain impudent freshness which gave at least a momentary pleasure .
" If what you say of clerks is true , they can only be as prosaic as your poetry .
Both being sick and being rebellious may be the wholesome thing on certain desperate occasions ; but I ' m hanged if I can see why they are poetical .
There is only one way by which that insult can be erased , and that way I choose .
" The pate de foie gras is not good here , but I can recommend the game ."
But the champagne can really be trusted .
" Well , if I am not drunk , I am mad ," replied Syme with perfect calm ; " but I trust I can behave like a gentleman in either condition .
Now no human words can give you any notion of why I brought you here .
What can I find more respectable than bishops and majors ?'
" I feel that I can confide anything to you , as you have promised to tell nobody .
" I can ' t tell the police you are an anarchist .
You can ' t tell the anarchists I ' m a policeman .
I can only watch you , knowing what you are ; you can only watch me , knowing what I am .
If no comrade suggests a name , I can only tell myself that that dear dynamiter , who is gone from us , has carried into the unknowable abysses the last secret of his virtue and his innocence ."
But only the eye of a friendship as deep and delicate as mine can perceive the deep foundation of solid meekness which lies at the base of him , too deep even for himself to see .
" I am not a madman ," reiterated Gregory , with a frightful sincerity which for a moment staggered the room , " but I give you a counsel which you can call mad if you like .
No , I will not call it a counsel , for I can give you no reason for it .
But what we think right is so damned different that there can be nothing between us in the way of concession .
The more his mother preached a more than Puritan abstinence the more did his father expand into a more than pagan latitude ; and by the time the former had come to enforcing vegetarianism , the latter had pretty well reached the point of defending cannibalism .
How can you talk of their leading one army or hurling one bolt .
They are under no illusions ; they are too intellectual to think that man upon this earth can ever be quite free of original sin and the struggle .
" How can I join you ?"
Or rather , I should not say see him , nobody ever sees him ; but you can talk to him if you like ."
It was not the ordinary darkness , in which forms can be faintly traced ; it was like going suddenly stone - blind .
" Of course , the Secretary of the branch told you everything that can be told .
But the one thing that can never be told is the last notion of the President , for his notions grow like a tropical forest .
The effect of this figure was not terrible like that of the President , but it had every diablerie that can come from the utterly grotesque .
" You hide as much as anybody ; but you can ' t do it , you see , you ' re such an ass !
" You can ' t get hold of it yet , Gogol ," he said in a fatherly way .
" It can ' t be !"
" There can ' t --"
I can ' t say .
" Can that old corpse be following me ?"
One comfort is , with a little brisk walking I can put a man like that as far away as Timbuctoo .
He made a wild gesture as if to knock the old man ' s hat off , called out something like " Catch me if you can ," and went racing away across the white , open Circus .
In an evolutionary sense , sir , the ape fades so gradually into the policeman , that I myself can never detect the shade .
I am in the British police force ; but as you tell me you are not in the British police force , I can only say that I met you in a dynamiters ' club .
" I can ' t take my face off here ," replied Professor de Worms .
You remember the old tale of the English clergyman who gave the last rites to the brigand of Sicily , and how on his death - bed the great robber said , ' I can give you no money , but I can give you advice for a lifetime : your thumb on the blade , and strike upwards .'
" As a matter of fact he lives some way off , on the other side of the river , but we can tell from here whether he has gone to bed ."
" Yes ," said de Worms , " behind that particular window which you can ' t see .
" You can find good English inns left by accident everywhere , like fossils ," explained the Professor .
" Well ," said Syme , " I can understand your putting on his dirty old beard for a night ' s practical joke , but I don ' t understand your never taking it off again ."
Inside I am really bursting with boyish merriment ; but I acted the paralytic Professor so well , that now I can ' t leave off .
So that when I am among friends , and have no need at all to disguise myself , I still can ' t help speaking slow and wrinkling my forehead -- just as if it were my forehead .
I can be quite happy , you understand , but only in a paralytic sort of way .
" Can you play the piano ?"
What the deuce else can you do ?
" Confound you , can ' t you answer ?"
" Please do not think me excessively abrupt ; but I advise you to alter those plans , or if it is too late for that , to follow your agent with all the support you can get for him .
Comrade Syme and I have had an experience which it would take more time to recount than we can afford , if we are to act on it .
So unless you or I can get on his track --"
" I ' m awfully glad you chaps have come so early ," he said , with a sort of schoolboy flippancy , " for we can all start for France together .
I tell you , you can say what you like , that fellow sold himself to the devil ; he can be in six places at once ."
I ' m no hand at casuistry , but I can ' t break my word to a modern pessimist .
Well , I can ' t turn on a man like that , and hunt him down .
" Yes ," assented the Professor , " you ' re quite right ; and we must hurry up , for I can see the Grey Nose standing out from France ."
But we are worse off than that , first because they can appeal to their organization and we cannot appeal to ours , and second because --"
The only thing I can see to do is actually to take advantage of the very things that are in the Marquis ' s favour .
" But how can the Marquis have insulted your aunt just now ?"
He can ' t refuse to meet you on such a small point of time and place .
He will choose a field somewhere near a wayside station , where he can pick up the train .
But I can fence well too , and I think I can keep him in play , at any rate , until the train is lost .
" To a man of the well - known skill and valour of Monsieur de St . Eustache ," said the Professor solemnly , " it must be a matter of indifference which method is adopted , and our principal has strong reasons for demanding the longer encounter , reasons the delicacy of which prevent me from being explicit , but for the just and honourable nature of which I can --"
The first was the old fear that any miracle might happen , the second the more hopeless modern fear that no miracle can ever happen .
I can do the one thing which Satan himself cannot do -- I can die ," and as the word went through his head , he heard a faint and far - off hoot , which would soon be the roar of the Paris train .
But one can hardly call one ' s nose a weapon ."
You can have no conception of how important it is to me .
" If anyone has any use for my left eyebrow ," he said , " he can have it .
" You are making a mistake ; but it can ' t be explained just now .
" My name is pretty well known to the police , and I can see well enough that you belong to them .
How hard they hunt us you can gather from the fact that we are driven to such disguises as those for which I apologise , and to such pranks as this one by which you suffer . "
I have fought for France , and it is hard if I can ' t fight for civilization ."
What can it mean ?"
Can you think of anything more like Sunday than this , that he should put all his powerful enemies on the Supreme Council , and then take care that it was not supreme ?
He had found the thing which the modern people call Impressionism , which is another name for that final scepticism which can find no floor to the universe .
" What can you mean by all this ?"
" They can ' t be running the real world in that way .
The rich man hasn ' t ; he can go away to New Guinea in a yacht .
Aristocrats were always anarchists , as you can see from the barons ' wars ."
" Millionaires I can understand ," said Syme thoughtfully , " they are nearly all mad .
We came here because this is the only place within twenty miles in which we can get horses ."
" Where can they have got the horses ?"
asked Syme , as he mechanically urged his steed to a canter .
" I was speaking with strict accuracy when I said that the ' Soleil d ' Or ' was the only place where one can get horses within twenty miles ."
" I am sorry to cut short a cultured discussion ," said the Colonel , " but can you lend me your motor - car now , in two minutes ?"
" I can ' t understand why it has grown so dark ," said the Professor at last in a low voice .
" There is only one set of lights that make me more cheerful ," he said , " and they are those lights of the police station which I can see beyond the town .
" No , I can ' t believe it .
" They have two rows of armed men across the road already ; I can see them from here .
I can only wallow in the exquisite comfort of my own exactitude ."
217 Peabody Buildings , and that I shall soon wake up with a jump ; or , if that ' s not it , I think that I am sitting in a small cushioned cell in Hanwell , and that the doctor can ' t make much of my case .
" You can believe in a sanity which is not merely your sanity .
" I tell you it can ' t be !"
We can ' t get there , for they hold the way .
" Even if the police do come now ," said the Professor mournfully , " they can do nothing with this mob ."
I can ' t trust my own bodily machinery .
You can make nothing .
You can only destroy .
" I can ' t make head or tail of old Sunday ' s little game any more than you can ," he said .
" Well ," said the Secretary , " I suppose we can find out soon , for tomorrow we have our next general meeting .
As far as I can make out , you want me to tell you what I am , and what you are , and what this table is , and what this Council is , and what this world is for all I know .
" He can ' t go astray now .
" What place can this be ?"
" Can it be the old devil ' s house ?
I can ' t wish old Sunday ' s balloon to burst because --"
How can I explain what my queer sympathy was ?
" And somehow ," concluded Bull , " that ' s why I can ' t help liking old Sunday .
how can I tell you ?
We can ' t think of a wicked man who is honestly and sincerely dreamy , because we daren ' t think of a wicked man alone with himself .
Each man of you finds Sunday quite different , yet each man of you can only find one thing to compare him to -- the universe itself .
He was clad in a fine but old - fashioned suit with knee - breeches ; its colour was that shade between blue , violet and grey which can be seen in certain shadows of the woodland .
" What can it all mean ?"
Oh , I can forgive God His anger , though it destroyed nations ; but I cannot forgive Him His peace ."
" I thought I hated everything more than common men can hate anything ; but I find that I do not hate everything so much as I hate you ! "
No agonies can be too great to buy the right to say to this accuser , ' We also have suffered .'
I can answer for every one of the great guards of Law whom he has accused .
Only in the blackness before it entirely destroyed his brain he seemed to hear a distant voice saying a commonplace text that he had heard somewhere , " Can ye drink of the cup that I drink of ?"
Though poor I have lived honest , and I have brought you up to be the same , Mary ; and I am sure the little ones will take after you ; for you ' ll be good to them -- as good to them as you can ."
She was tired of speaking , for she was very weak ; but she took their little hands , as they laid them on the bed and joining them all together , she said , " Bless you , dears ; bless you ; love and help one another all you can .
" Sure ," says one of the neighbours , " we can do no less than give a helping hand to the poor orphans , that are so ready to help themselves ."
My hands must be washed before I can do anything ."
" There she is , yonder , lying under the great corner stone ; you can just see her leg .
this is come to us just in right time -- now you can pay for the slated house .
" It can ' t be taken from us ," cried Edmund , " poor orphans though we are , and he a rich gentleman , as he calls himself .
Let him say and do what he will , he can ' t hurt our good name ."
He ' s grown quite young again , I think , and then he ' s so fat he can hardly wag ."
" But can ' t I look where you looked ?"
" Yes ," said the man , " you can ; I ' ve just dropped , amongst this heap of rubbish , a fine piece of crystal that I got to - day ."
" I don ' t know -- because I can ' t find anybody to play with me to - day .
" No , I can ' t ; I ' m busy ."
Come along , my lad ; we can but try ."
" I ' ve no story , ma ' am , to tell , but as how mammy says he must go to the fair Monday fortnight , to be sold , if she can ' t get the two guineas for her rent ; and I should be main sorry to part with him , for I love him , and he loves me ; so I ' ll work for him , I will , all I can .
" There , he shall have that into the bargain for his honesty -- honesty is the best policy -- there ' s a lucky penny for you , that I ' ve kept ever since I can remember ."
" Ah , no , I can ' t run , indeed ," said he , hanging back heavily ; " you know I can play all day long if I like it , so I don ' t mind play as you do , who have only one hour for it ."
" No , I tell you I can ' t ; I ' m as tired as if I had been working all day long as hard as a horse ."
" That ' s very odd ," said Lawrence , and yawned , for want of some better answer ; then taking out a handful of halfpence ,--" See what I got from father today , because I asked him just at the right time , when he had drunk a glass or two ; then I can get anything I want out of him -- see !
" I can guess ; I know what I ' d do with it if it was mine .
No , no ," catching hold of him , " I believe you can ' t move ; but I ' ll make you ."
" Oh ," said the lady recollecting herself , " I can ' t blame you , for there is no mat ."
" I am very sorry to hear that ," said the lady ; " I wish we could find somebody who would do them , if he can ' t .
Nothing TRULY GREAT can be accomplished without toil and time .
" Spend your time no more in weeding in my garden , you can employ yourself much better ; you shall have the reward of your ingenuity as well as of your industry .
Make as many more such mats as you can , and I will take care and dispose of them for you ."
" Not now ," said the lady , laughing ; " but I will come to Ashton to - morrow evening ; perhaps your mother can find me a few strawberries ."
Besides , what signifies talking , you can ' t go to the cock - fight , or the fair either , if you don ' t ; and I tell ye we don ' t mean to steal it ; we ' ll pay it by Monday night ."
" I am feeling for the half - crown , but I can ' t find it ."
said she , turning round to the old woman , " my Betty serves you , and she ' s a tight and stirring lassy , ma ' am , I can assure --"
" Why , that ' s true ; as I was coming along all alone , for the rest came round , and I came a short cut across yon field -- no , you can ' t see it , madam , where you stand -- but if you were here --"
said he to himself , " it must be -- yet surely it can ' t be Lawrence !"
said Jem , springing forwards when Lawrence ' s hands were going to be tied , " let him go -- won ' t you ?-- can ' t you let him go ?"
" Certainly ; whenever your mistress can spare you , I shall be very glad to see you ; and remember , if ever you get into any difficulty , don ' t be afraid to come to me .
" I ' m sure I hope so too ," observed Mrs . Pomfret ; " but I can ' t say ; for my part , I ' ve no great notion of those low people .
But then , ma ' am , edication can ' t change the NATUR that ' s in one , they say ; and one ' s that born naturally bad and low , they say , all the edication in the world won ' t do no good ; and , for my part , ma ' am , I know you knows best ; but I should be afraid to let any of those Villaintropic folks get into my house ; for nobody can tell the natur of them aforehand .
Let them both have a fair trial , and at the end of the month I can decide which I like best , and which we had better keep ."
All this Franklin bore with fortitude ; nor did he envy Felix the dainties which he ate , sometimes close beside him : " For ," said he to himself , " I have a clear conscience , and that is more than Felix can have .
I ' m sure it ' s what I can ' t pretend to , unless you do me the justice to forbid him my places ."
" Nothing you can give me will do ," answered Franklin , steadily , " so it is useless to say any more about it -- I hope I shall not be questioned ."
" To be sure , ma ' am , what I say IS , that , without the spirit of prophecy , one can nowadays account for what has passed .
" To be sure , ma ' am -- how can I help believing him ?
I never found him out in the least symptom of a lie since ever he came into the house ; so one can ' t help believing in him , like him or not ."
answered Franklin , starting ; " I ' m sorry , but I can ' t do that , for I ' ve promised my mistress never to let it out of my own hands ."
" You can ' t ?"
cried Corkscrew , changing his tone ; " then , sir , I can ' t take you to the play ."
What harm can it do , to lend Mr . Corkscrew the key for five minutes ?
" No , but I can ' t oblige him in this ; for , as I told you before , my mistress trusted me .
" But we ' ll have the key from him in spite of all his obstinacy ," said Felix ; " and let him make his story good as he can afterwards .
Why , sir , they can ' t be gone to the play .
" Nothing can be done without Susan !
is he so nice that he can eat none but guinea - hen ' s eggs ?"
We can do nothing without YOU , dear Susan ," cried Rose , running to meet her , at the moment she saw her .
said Susan , " don ' t wait for me ; I can ' t come to you , but ," added she , pointing to the tuft of double cowslips in the garden , " gather those for poor little Mary ; I promised them to her , and tell her the violets are under a hedge just opposite the turnstile , on the right as we go to church .
never mind me ; I can ' t come -- I can ' t stay , for my father wants me ."
He has found what he calls a flaw in my lease ; and the lease , he tells me , is not worth a farthing , and that he can turn us all out of our farm to - morrow if he pleases ; and sure enough he will please , for I have thwarted him this day , and he swears he ' ll be revenged of me .
" Thank you ," said Susan , " my mother is ill ; I can ' t leave her , you know ."
It is a pity you can ' t come with us ," said all the children ; and little Mary ran after Susan to the cottage door .
How can I be grateful enough to such a mother as this ?"
" Little I can ' t so well call her now , since she ' s grown tall and slender to look at ; and glad I am she is grown up likely to look at ; for handsome is that handsome does ; she thinks no more of her being handsome than I do myself ; yet she has as proper a respect for herself , ma ' am , as you have ; and I always see her neat , and with her mother , ma ' am , or fit people , as a girl should be .
" You have really said enough to excite my curiosity ," said her mistress ; " pray send for her immediately ; we can see her before we go out to walk ."
She had , it is true , been very busy ; but orderly people can be busy and neat at the same time .
Can ' t you stop gathering those things for a minute , and chat a bit with us , Susan ?"
" I can ' t stay , indeed , Miss Barbara ; for my mother ' s broth is just wanted , and I ' m in a hurry ."
What need have you to trouble her for news about the Abbey folks , when your own papa has been there all the morning , and is just come in , and can tell you everything ?"
I pledge my credit upon it , sir , it can ' t stand a single term in law or equity ."
" Why , then , that can be done away in a moment .
" What can that be , sir ?"
" It can ' t be helped ," said Susan , with a sigh .
" It can ' t be helped -- how do you know that ?"
" You CAN help it , Susan ."
said Susan ; " but what can that do ?"
" What good can any lamb do ?
" Attorney Case told me so ; he can get him a week ' s longer leave of absence , and he has promised he will ."
" How can ye be so careless , child ?
All of them , I think , seem to be wrong , if I can read ," said her father , rather angrily , and he pointed out to her sundry strange mistakes .
" I am blind ," said the old man , " and cannot see your faces ; but I know you all asunder by your voices , and I can guess pretty well at all your humours and characters by your voices ."
" Can you so , indeed ?"
Can you tell us what sort of person she is ?"
" That I can , I think , without being a conjurer ," said the old man , lifting the boy up on his knee ; " YOUR sister Susan is good - natured ."
" Though I am blind ," said the harper , " I can hear , you know , and I heard from your sister herself all that I told you of her , that she was good - tempered and good - natured and fond of you ."
Well , play us a tune , if you can play ever a good one -- play me -- let ' s see , what shall he play , Bob ?"
you can see the copper through it quite plain .
" I ' ll lead him , I can lead him ," said he ; and John ran on before them , to gather king - cups in the meadow .
" There is the high road straight before you ," said Susan to the lad , who was carrying his master ' s harp ; " you can ' t miss it .
" Honestly and handsomely , that I ' m sure of beforehand ," said her proud mother ; " but how I can ' t make out , except by the baking .
The least she can do for you is to take you in her carriage , WHICH costs nothing , but is just a common civility , to a ball ."
I can see , you know , something of the fashions to - morrow at the Abbey .
They can never enjoy the present moment .
The housekeeper came close up to the dressing table , and continued , " I never like to speak till I ' m sure , ma ' am , and I ' m not quite sure , to say certain , in this case , ma ' am , but still I think it right to tell you , which can ' t wrong anybody , what came across my mind about this same guinea - hen , ma ' am ; and you can inquire into it , and do as you please afterwards , ma ' am .
" If we were to accept a lamb from a rich neighbour on my estate ," said he , " I am afraid we should mortify many of our poor tenants , who can have little to offer , though , perhaps , they may bear us thorough good - will notwithstanding ."
Pray , Betty , don ' t forget that Mrs . Strathspey can ' t breakfast without honey .
" But , surely ," said Bab , " we can contrive to get some honey in the neighbourhood ."
Step over to her in the morning with MY COMPLIMENTS , and see what you can do .
" Can ' t you ?"
Can ' t you do something for me ?
Pray , how am I to be fit to be seen at breakfast by Mrs . Strathspey ; and I suppose I can ' t go to the ball either to - morrow , after all !"
" No , that you can ' t expect to do , indeed ," said Betty , the comforter .
" Is there anything in our house can be of service to her ?"
This is scandalous behaviour , and what , I assure you , I can ' t countenance ."
said Farmer Price ; " here ' s the penny then , but who can it be from , I wonder ?
Who can think of writing to me , in this world ?"
" However , I can show you , Sir Arthur , just for my own satisfaction and yours , a few lines of a memorandum on a slip of paper , which was given me by your relation , the gentleman who lived here before , and let me my farm .
" So great a lawyer , Mr . Case , as you are ," replied Sir Arthur , " must know , that a man cannot give up that to which he has no legal title ; and in this case it is impossible that , with the best intentions to oblige me in the world , you can give up this bit of land to me , because it is mine already , as I can convince you effectually by a map of the adjoining land , which I have fortunately safe amongst my papers .
" You are a scholar ; you write a good hand ; you can keep accounts , cannot you ?"
" No , sir ," said Price , " I can ' t say I did THAT ; for she mostly taught it herself , but I taught her a little arithmetic , as far as I knew , on our winter nights , when I had nothing better to do ."
I shall tell them that it is your good conduct which has obtained it for them ; and if you have anything to ask , any little favour for any of your companions , which we can grant , now ask , Susan .
" Yes ," said Susan , " and the next time he comes , I can give him one of my guinea - hen ' s eggs , and I shall show my lamb , Daisy ."
" I ' ll ask my mother to ask Sir Arthur to try and find out which way that good old man went after the ball ; and if he ' s above ground , we ' ll have him back by Susan ' s birthday , and he shall sit here -- just exactly here by this , our bush , and he shall play -- I mean , if he pleases -- that same tune for us , and I shall learn it -- I mean , if I can -- in a minute ."
As to the rest , we can have the windows mended ; and do you keep all the sixpences you earn for yourself ."
I shall begin to teach him to - morrow morning ; and then , father , you know people often pay a great deal for sending messengers ; and no boy can run , no horse can gallop , so fast as a bird can fly ; therefore the bird must be the best messenger , and I should be paid the best price .
" If we can ' t have it by fair means , we will by foul ," said Cox ; and a few days afterwards the pigeon was gone .
Nothing can be more shortsighted than cunning .
" And can Bell eat more upon her birthday than upon any other day ?"
I can easily believe that she is happy whilst she is eating a mince pie , or whilst she is playing ; but how does everybody ' s drinking her health at dinner make her happy ?"
" Well then , mamma , the day after to - morrow I can show you the drawer .
I can ' t stay ."
" Can ' t you ?"
and I can ' t , nor mother neither , buy another ; and I can ' t do anything else for my bread ."
" Then you can buy another with that ," said Laura , dropping the half - guinea into her hand ; and she shut the window before the child could find words to thank her , but not before she saw a look of joy and gratitude , which gave Laura more pleasure probably than all the praise which could have been bestowed upon her generosity .
And will you , or can you , or should you , always give , merely because others EXPECT , or because somebody else gives ?"
But , for instance , to make a present of a thing that you know can be of no use to a person you neither love nor esteem , because it is her birthday , and because everybody gives her something , and because she expects something , and because your godmother says she likes that people should be generous , seems to me , my dear Rosamond , to be , since I must say it , rather more like folly than generosity ."
If you have sense enough to see your own mistakes , and can afterwards avoid them , you will never be a fool ."
But then I say I won ' t wear it without the lace -- I can ' t wear it without the lace , and I won ' t ."
repeated Bell , impatiently ; " I can ' t wait till then ; I must see it this minute ."
But you can ' t get any if she would , for this was made on purpose for me on my birthday , and nobody can get a bit more anywhere , if they would give the world for it ."
cried Bell ; for she had already learned , either from her maid or her mother , the mean pride which values things not for being really pretty or useful , but for being such as nobody else can procure .
" Nobody can get any like it , I say ," repeated Bell ; " nobody in all London can make it but one person , and that person will never make a bit for anybody but me , I am sure .
Exclamations of sorrow were heard in various tones ; and " Who can have done this ?"
" Nor Miss Bell , neither , ma ' am ,-- I can answer for her ; for she never knew of its being there , because I never so much as mentioned it to her , that there was such a thing in the house , because I knew Miss Rosamond wanted to surprise her with the secret ; so I never mentioned a sentence of it -- did I , Miss Bell ?"
It is not only by giving away money that we can show generosity ; it is by giving up to others anything that we like ourselves : and therefore ," added he , smiling , " it is really generous of you to give your sister the thing you like best of all others ."
If it is an impossibility , I ' ve no more to say ; only , for the soul of me , I can ' t see the great unpossibility , wife .
Why , they came only in a chaise and pair , to be sure ; I can ' t deny that .
So , Mr . Newington , if you don ' t think proper to go up and inform the ladies above , that the Dolphin rooms are not for them , I must SPEAK myself , though ' tis a thing I never do when I can help it .
My dear , you can speak a power better than I can ; so take it all upon yourself , if you please ; for , old - fashioned as I and my tankard here be , I can ' t make a speech that borders on the uncivil order , to a lady like , for the life and lungs of me .
Civilities and rarities are out o ' season for them that can ' t pay for them in this world ; and very proper .
* Salt , the cant name given by the Eton lads to the money collected at Montem .
Between you and me , my best hunter has been ruinationed ; and I can ' t afford to be mum .
Where ' s the little account ?-- I have money sent me for my Montem dress , and I can squeeze that much out of it .
I give you notice , I ' m going back to Eton as fast as I can gallop ; and who knows what plain speaking may do with the Eton lads ?
Mr . Bursal , can you inform me why Joe , my groom , does not make his appearance ?
Yes , that I can , child ; because he is with his ' orses , where he ought to be .
Well , well , he can afford it ; and I do love to see my children make a figure for their money .
what can it be ?--( going ).
And it must be allowed that nothing in nature can have a better effect than Mr . Drake ' s flesh - colour and blue , with this Spanish hat , ma ' m , you see .
Why , if quality will travel the road this way , incognito , how can they expect to be known and treated as quality ?
Scrubs , I don ' t , nor can ' t , nor won ' t call them that pay their debts honestly .
Scrubs , I don ' t , nor won ' t , nor can ' t , call them that behave as handsome as young Mr . Talbot did here to me this morning about the hunter .
But isn ' t it a pity she can ' t stay for the Montem , poor old lady !
That ' s all I can say and you ' d make my wife very happy ; for she ' s a good woman , to say nothing of myself .
I can ' t , for the soul of me , bring myself to say that Bursal ' s not purse - proud , and you can .
It is all I can do to forgive this .
be easy , can ' t ye ?-- there ' s no unmasking at all in the case .
Talbot says blunt things ; but I don ' t think he ' s what you can call clever -- hey , Wheeler ?
Well , if all depends upon me , I ' ll see what I can do for you .
How young gentlemen , now , can bring themselves for to tell such lies , is to me , now , a matter of amazement , like , that I can ' t noways get over .
Well , don ' t then , for I can ' t believe it ; and you put me out .
At the " Windmill ," at Salt Hill , young lady ; and ill or well , you can ' t be better .
Is there ever a seat one can set on in that _H_arbour yonder ?
What can we do without you ?
You can do very well without me .
You can do very well without me .
In a huff ?-- Ay , now , there it is !-- Well , when a man ' s MAD , to be sure , he ' s mad -- and that ' s all that can be said about it .
But what can have become of Talbot ?
Wherever you come , Rory O ' Ryan , no one else can be heard .
When they have almost all passed , Lord John says , But where can Mr . Talbot be all this time ?
Oons , sir , when a man ' s put out , he can ' t go on with his story .
He can wait , and I cannot -- wind and tide wait for no man .
He could not believe that anyone could be so malicious as to injure him on purpose --" And even if they did all this on purpose to vex me ," said he to himself , " the best thing I can do , is , not to let it vex me .
you can get a bit of whip cord twice as long as that for twopence ; and who cares for twopence !
I ' ll tell you what , I can use the string that goes round my hat !"
" Come ," said he , " it can ' t be helped ; but give me the string because THAT may still be of use for something else ."
" Pick it up , then , and bring it to me , quick , can ' t you , child ," cried Hal , " for Lady Di ' s sons are waiting for me ?"
How can anyone in the world know so much about the matter as I , who have dined with Lady Diana Sweepstakes but yesterday , and heard all about it from beginning to end ?
All that can be done , my dear boys , in these difficult cases , is to judge for yourselves , which opinions , and which people , are the most reasonable ."
Hal next offered some of his cakes to his uncle and cousin ; but they thanked him , and refused to eat any , because , they said , they were not hungry ; so he ate and ate as he walked along , till at last he stopped , and said , " This bun tastes so bad after the queen cakes , I can ' t bear it !"
" I can show you when we go home , Ben ," said his uncle , " an entertaining paper upon such shadows .
" I don ' t mind so much for myself , sir ," said the lad ; " but I can ' t work so well now , as I used to do before my accident , for my old mother , who has had a STROKE of the palsy ; and I ' ve a many little brothers and sisters not well able yet to get their own livelihood , though they be as willing as willing can be ."
" No ," said Hal , " nor can it be explained : if you don ' t understand it , that ' s not my fault .
I was just wishing I had a pair of gloves to keep my fingers warm to - day , for I never can shoot well when my hands are benumbed .
" You can ' t march , man , without your arms ?"
" We can leave the children to walk , you know ," said she to the gentleman who helped her to mount her horse .
said she , " why can ' t he keep his hat upon his head ?"
I shall lose my turn to shoot ; oh , give me the coat ; I don ' t mind how it is , if I can but get it on ."
" My hands are benumbed ; I can scarcely feel ," said he , rubbing them , and blowing upon the ends of his fingers .
" Come , we can ' t wait whilst you rub your fingers , man -- shoot away ."
He little knew how easily acquaintance who call themselves friends can change when their interest comes in the slightest degree in competition with their friendship .
You can ' t see him , so go about your business , I say .
Perhaps he can wait a little while .
You can ' t see my master this hour ; but miss will let you stay here .
I wonder what can make him sigh so !
If he can ' t wait , let him go about his business .
Why , it has but just struck twelve ; if he can ' t wait , he can go about his business , can ' t he ?
Oh , sir , he can wait .
Ay , if Dr . Sparerib could cure one of the gout , then , indeed , I should think something of him ; but , as to my leaving off my bottle of port , it ' s nonsense ; it ' s all nonsense ; I can ' t do it ; I can ' t , and won ' t , for all the Dr . Spareribs in Christendom ; that ' s poz !
Ah , now , I ' m glad he can speak ; now tell papa ; and you need not be afraid to speak to him , for he is very good - natured .
What can you understand , I want to know , of the law ?
Old M . Please , your worship , with submission , I CAN say nothing but what I said before .
I ' ve heard nothing yet that I can understand .
Where children see only a part they cannot judge of the whole ; and from the superficial view which they can have in short visits and desultory conversation , they can form only a false estimate of the objects of human happiness , a false notion of the nature of society , and false opinions of characters .
Her mother had taught Sophy that it was best to let herself alone , and not to distort either her person or her mind in acquiring grimace , which nothing but the fashion of the moment can support , and which is always detected and despised by people of real good sense and politeness .
People must think children are very silly , or else they can never have reflected upon the nature of belief in their own minds , if they imagine that children will believe the words that are said to them , by way of moral , when the countenance , manner , and every concomitant circumstance tell them a different tale .
" Well , Sophy , leave off drawing for an instant ," said Frederick , " and tell us what answer can we send ?"
" Can !-- we can send what answer we please ."
" You have made such confusion ," replied Sophy , " between ' couldn ' t ' and ' wouldn ' t ' and ' shouldn ' t ,' that I can ' t understand you ; surely they are all different things ."
Besides , she understood the ' Rule of Three ,' which was no conjuring trick , better than you did , though she is a woman ; and she can reason , too , mamma says ."
how can you tell that , brother ?"
Oh , brother , she can do anything ; and she could make the best plum - pudding in the whole world , I ' m sure , in a minute , if it were necessary ."
" Come , Mr . Frederick ," said she after tea , " you promised to make me laugh ; and nobody can make me laugh so well as yourself ."
I don ' t see anything here I can eat , ma ' am .
I can ' t cut it , I say ; it ' s as hard as a deal board .
It ' s a very hard case , Mrs . Carbuncle , that I can never have a bit of anything that I can eat at my own table , Mrs . Carbuncle , since I was married , ma ' am , I that am the easiest man in the whole world to please about my dinner .
Such a wife as she makes ," continued Mrs . Theresa , lifting up her hands and eyes to heaven , " and so much as she has gone through , the brute ought to be ashamed of himself if he does not leave her something extraordinary in his will ; for turn it which way she will , she can never keep a carriage , or live like anybody else , on her jointure , after all , she tells me , poor soul !
Sir Charles will come into a fine fortune himself next year , if he can keep clear of gambling , which I hear is his foible , poor young man !
" No , Marianne , I can do no more .
said Mrs . Theresa ; " what can make you sigh so bitterly ?
but one can ' t be surprised at meeting with extraordinary characters amongst that race of people , actors by profession , you know ; for they are brought up from the egg to make their fortune , or at least their bread by their oddities .
" Stay ," said Mrs . Tattle , whose curiosity was excited ; " what can the Edens want with chimney - sweepers at this time o ' night , I wonder ?
" Upon my word , ma ' am ," said the servant , " I can ' t say ; but I ' ll step down below and inquire .
" Now ," continued Mrs . Theresa , turning to Frederick , as soon as the servant had left the room , " now , Mr . Frederick Montague , I have a favour - - such a favour -- to ask of you ; it ' s a favour which only you can grant ; you have such talents , and would do the thing so admirably ; and my Lady Battersby would quite adore you for it .
Between friends , can there be any harm in showing one ' s talents ?
But then his voice and way , and altogether , if one could get them to the life , they ' d be better than anything on the stage ; better even than anything I ' ve seen to - night ; and I think you ' d make a capital Quaker for my Lady Battersby ; but then the thing is , one can never get to hear the old quiz talk .
" I think he is in the right not to go up , though he can do it so easily , to see that gentleman ; I mean on purpose to mimic and laugh at him afterwards .
" Lud , child , you are turned simpleton all of a sudden ; how can your brother disturb her more than the real chimney - sweeper ?"
Can nobody think of anything that will stop blood in a minute ?
Can nobody think of anything that will stop blood in a minute ?
Come , Mr . Frederick , this way , into my room , and I ' ll give you a towel and some clean water , and you can get rid of this masquerade dress .
And now can you forgive me , sir ?"
I can ' t make out this one word ."
I have done my best to please you ; but if anybody else can please you better , I shall be glad of it .
We can alter it .
" I said I could bear to see all this , and I can ," said he ; " now it is all over ."
They hope to WIN , when they cannot EARN ; and as they can never be convinced by those who speak sense , it is no wonder they are always persuaded by those who talk nonsense .
cried he ; " but I can ' t stay to talk about it now .
cried Archer , " that ' s the way we are always to be governed by a man in a wig , who says he has good reasons , and can ' t tell them .
Archer was always sure that " THE RIGHT " was what his party chose to do ; that is , what he chose to do himself ; and such is the influence of numbers upon each other , in conquering the feelings of shame and in confusing the powers of reasoning , that in a few minutes " the right " was forgotten , and each said to himself , " To be sure , Archer is a very clever boy , and he can ' t be mistaken "; or , " to be sure , Townsend thinks so , and he would not do anything to get us into a scrape "; or , " to be sure , everybody will agree to this but myself , and I can ' t stand out alone , to be pointed at as a Greybeard and a slave .
Everybody thinks it is right , and everybody can ' t be wrong ."
" I know , I know ," said Fisher , " and what she said about your friends being lucky -- that went a great way with many ," added he , with a sagacious nod of his head ; " I can tell you THAT -- more than you think .
" Oh ," thought he to himself ; " Archer ' s so careless about money , he will never think of asking me for the half - crown again ; and now he ' ll want no candles for the THEATRE ; or , at anyrate , it will be some time first ; and maybe , Aunt Barbara may be got to give me that much at Christmas ; then , if the worst comes to the worst , one can pay Archer .
" Look ye here -- touch these - - put your hand to them -- pull , push , kick -- put a little spirit into it , man -- kick like an Archer , if you can ; away with ye .
We can ' t unbar the shutters ."
Nothing can be more melancholy than forced merriment .
And Townsend , why , he has puns in plenty ; but , when there ' s any work to be done , he ' s the worst fellow to be near one in the world -- he can do nothing but laugh at his own puns .
If these be not good reasons , none better can be assigned for Archer ' s conduct .
I only begged you to keep it till supper - time , when perhaps you ' ll want it more , and Townsend , who can ' t bear the slightest thing that crosses his own whims , and who thinks there ' s nothing in this world to be minded but his own diversion , calls me a TYRANT .
The first thing I ask you to do for your own good , and when , if you had common sense , you must know I can want nothing but your good , you rebel against me .
Can such a thing as YOU have a party ?"
" One party is just as good as another ; it is only a question which can get the upper hand ; and we had your hands tied just now ."
and SUCH a manager , who can do nothing for one ?"
We ' ll let it down , my lad , in a trice ; bar me out who can !"
I can never understand Townsend ' s PUNS .
Besides , anybody can make puns ; and one doesn ' t want wit , either , at all times ; for instance , when one is going to settle about dinner , or business of consequence .
Why , now we can hold out as long as you please .
Let us see ," said he , dividing the provisions upon the table ; " we can hold out to - day , and all to - morrow , and part of next day , maybe .
I have felt the want of a friend , and I am determined to make one if I can ."
" But how will he find out WHAT IS honourable , unless he can reason ?"
How can I ?"
Seats for the young competitors were raised one above another , in a semicircle , some yards distant from the table , and the judges ' chairs , under canopies of lilacs and laburnums , forming another semicircle , closed the amphitheatre .
I can buy her another mandarin when the old peddler comes to the door , if that ' s all .
I CAN do no more , CAN I ?"
" I ' m sure I can do no more than buy her another , CAN I !"
" How can you compare Louisa to me !"
Perhaps to tell things just as they were , she was not quite so much inclined to kiss Cecilia as she would have been before the fall of her mandarin ; but this was the utmost extent of her malice , if it can be called malice .
can ' t you answer , then ?
that ' s a cant word which you learnt of my friend Leonora , as you call her ; but she is not my friend now ."
I can determine whether or no you apply to what I give you to learn ; whether you attend to what I desire you to do , and avoid what I desire you not to do .
You are good - natured , Cecilia ; for you are desirous to oblige and serve your companions -- to gain them praise , and save them from blame -- to give them pleasure , and relieve them from pain ; but Leonora is good - tempered , for she can bear with their foibles , and acknowledge her own .
In short , her temper is perfectly good ; for it can bear and forbear ."
" It may ," replied Mrs . Villars ; " but it is not wishes alone which can improve us in anything .
" But , my dear , how can Leonora tell whether your heart be good or bad ?
" Then the best definition ," said Mrs . Villars , " which you can give me of a bad heart is , that it is some constant propensity to hurt others , and to do wrong for the sake of doing wrong ."
But how can you , Cecilia , who feel such a strong sense of shame , and such an eager desire to improve , imagine that you have a bad heart ?"
Show me that you have as much perseverance as you have candour , and I shall not despair of your becoming everything that I could wish ."
For it is habit which confers ease ; and without ease , even in moral actions , there can be no grace .
exclaimed Cecilia ; " don ' t you perceive that if any of you win it , you have nothing to do but to put the clips a little further from the edge , but if we get it , we can ' t make it larger ?"
Leonora was her equal ; they were her inferiors , and submission is much easier to a vain mind , where it appears to be voluntary , than when it is the necessary tribute to justice or candour .
All small objects and small errors she had been taught to disregard as trifles ; and her impatient disposition was perpetually leading her into more material faults ; yet her candour in confessing these , she had been suffered to believe , was sufficient reparation and atonement .
Without determining which species of love is the most flattering to others , we can easily decide which is the most agreeable feeling to our minds .
said she ; " then I can ' t have it .
I can ' t unscrew it ; will you try ?"
" Yes , but ," said she , stopping herself , " how can I confess it ?
Oh , I never can !
" How can she be so happy !"
And how pleasing Cecilia can be when she wishes to please !-- how candid she is !-- how much she can improve herself !
" Yes , if I could I would choose both of you ," said Louisa , " but you know I can only choose which I like the best ."
" Yes , I can prove to you ," said Mrs . Villars , " that Leonora has forgiven you .
If anybody else had told me so , I could not have believed them , because I remember the box so well ; but I can ' t help believing Leonora .'
" Children of two or three years old , who can scarcely crawl along upon the ground , in company with boys of five or six , are employed in this pretty trade .
" He always tells me that the buyer has need of a hundred eyes , and if one can blind the whole hundred , so much the better .
" The whole truth of the matter is , Francisco , that you envy my good luck , and can ' t bear to hear this money jingle in my hand .
When I am found out for what I am , or when the worst comes to the worst , I can drive a stupid ass , with his panniers filled with rubbish , as well as you do now , HONEST FRANCISCO ."
What can I want more ?"
can ' t you ?"
said Piedro , in a supplicating tone ; " CAN ' T you have thoughts of it ?
" Can ' t you ?"
Can this Piedro be a friend of yours ?"
" I wished to have been his friend ; but I see I can ' t ," said Francisco .
Thank you for its being once more in my careless hands , and tell me , I beg , whenever I can do you any service .
By - the - by , I can make up for you a fruit stall .
" That I ' ll explain to you with pleasure , as far as I know them myself ; but when I ' m at fault , my father , who is cleverer than I am , and understands trigonometry , can help us out ."
" I ' ll go this minute into the wood - market , and see if I can find your faggot .
" We can go to it ," said Francisco , " and I hope we shall recover your basketful ."
" You must come with me to Carlo ' s , and see how I spend my evenings ; then complain of me , if you can ."
None can be ignorant that near Naples is the celebrated volcanic mountain of Vesuvius ;-- that , from time to time , there happen violent eruptions from this mountain ; that is to say , flames and immense clouds of smoke issue from different openings , mouths , or CRATERS , as they are called , but more especially from the summit of the mountain , which is distinguished by the name of THE crater .
If you will give him some knowledge of your art , I will , as far as money can recompense you for your loss of time , pay whatever you may think reasonable for his instruction ."
One day , Signor Camillo came behind Francisco , as he was drawing with much intentness , and tapping him upon the shoulder , he said to him : " Put up your pencils and follow me , I can depend upon your integrity ; I have pledged myself for it .
" I have no need to steal hats ; I can afford to buy better than you ' ll have upon your head .
" If they are friends , they can wait ," said Piedro .
" You need not be ashamed of being seen in my company now , I can tell you ; for I am , as I always told you I should be , the richest man of the two ."
We shall live , whilst we can afford it , like great folks , you will see ; and I shall enjoy the envy that will be felt by some of my old friends , the little Neapolitan merchants , who will change their note when they see my change of fortune .
The old gardener , Francisco ' s father , was one of those who endeavoured to THINK THE BEST ; and all that he said upon the subject was , that he would not exchange Francisco the Honest for Piedro the Lucky ; that one can ' t judge of the day till one sees the evening as well as the morning .
He found the truth of the proverb , " that credit lost is like a Venice glass broken -- it can ' t be mended again ."
" The Count de Flora has promised him a liberal portion of all the fine furniture , plate and jewels that can be saved from his villa at Torre del Greco .
" A great while ago ; no wonder you have forgotten me ," said the man ; " but I can recall the night to your recollection .
Nay , hear me , I confess that I purloined that diamond cross ; but I can do the count a great service , upon condition that he pardons me .
" Yes , son , and a charming one it is , and a handsome piece of land near it -- all at a safe distance , too , from Mount Vesuvius ; and can you guess how I came by it ?-- it was given to me for having a good son ."
" And for that very reason you should not ask him , because , you know he can ' t refuse you anything ."
I had better go back , and just tell them that I ' m very sorry I can ' t get their shuttlecock ; do come back with me ."
" No ," said Hardy , " I can ' t go back ; and you ' d better not ."
I can ' t get through the hedge ," cried Loveit , in a lamentable tone , whilst the dog growled hideously , and sprang forward to the extremity of his chain .
" I can ' t get out !
" I can ' t come now ," said Loveit , drawing away his arm .
If you hope for MY pardon , I can tell you it ' s not to be had without asking for ."
" You don ' t think he ' s such a fool , when he can get himself off ," said Tarlton .
" Ay , sir ," interrupted Mr . William Power , " get that out of him if you can -- ask him ."
" Not because you ask it ," said Mr . Trueman to the guilty penitents , " though I should be glad to oblige you -- it wouldn ' t be just ; but there ," pointing to Hardy , " there is one who has merited a reward ; the highest I can give him is that of pardoning his companions ."
" Yes ," said the old woman ; " I will try what you can do ; but I must go up the hill along with you for the first two or three times , for fear you should get yourselves hurt ."
I told you then that I could not afford to buy such things for you ; but now that you can earn halfpence for yourselves , children , it is fair should taste a ripe plum and bit of gingerbread for once and a way in your lives ."
Stand you hereabouts , half - way up the hill , and the moment you see any carriage coming along the road , run as fast as you can and call me ."
" No , no ," said Paul , " you need not ask any woman , or anybody but me ; I can tell you all about it , as well as anybody in the whole world ."
" Why , not so well as my grandmother , perhaps , but , Anne , I can tell you that you must not talk yourself , Anne , but you must listen to me quietly , or else you won ' t understand what I am going to tell you , for I can assure you that I don ' t think I quite understood it myself , Anne , the first time my grandmother told it to me , though I stood stock still listening my best ."
I know where blankets can be got .
Those who threw it you gave it you by mistake , I warrant ; and what I would have you do is , to go to Dunstable , and try if you can , at either of the inns find out the person who gave it to you .
All you can do is to go and inquire for the gentleman who was reading in the chaise ."
Here ' s the postillion can tell you so .
He is going to bed ; he is tired and can ' t see you himself .
" But I can be certain whether the guinea you returned be mine or no ," said the gentleman .
" We like to have something to do always , if we could , sir ," said Paul ; " but we are forced to be idle sometimes , because grandmother has not always things for us to do that we CAN do well ."
" Immense as whales , the motion of whose vast bodies can in a peaceful calm trouble the ocean til it boil ."
Some say the whale can ' t open his mouth , but that is a fable .
They frequently climb up the masts to see whether they can see a whale , for the first discoverer has a ducat for his pains .
" Myself have agreed to try whether I can master and kill this Sperma - ceti whale , for I could never hear of any of that sort that was killed by any man , such is his fierceness and swiftness ."
Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth ; whenever it is a damp , drizzly November in my soul ; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses , and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet ; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me , that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street , and methodically knocking people ' s hats off -- then , I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can .
They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in .
It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself , without taking care of ships , barques , brigs , schooners , and what not .
The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous , considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills , and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven .
But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor , I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage ; this the invisible police officer of the Fates , who has the constant surveillance of me , and secretly dogs me , and influences me in some unaccountable way -- he can better answer than any one else .
Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers , the Fates , put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage , when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies , and short and easy parts in genteel comedies , and jolly parts in farces -- though I cannot tell why this was exactly ; yet , now that I recall all the circumstances , I think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises , induced me to set about performing the part I did , besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment .
Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights ?
You shuddered as you gazed , and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death - harvesting with such a hacking , horrifying implement .
" Just as you please ; I ' m sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress , and it ' s a plaguy rough board here "-- feeling of the knots and notches .
But to - night he went out a peddling , you see , and I don ' t see what on airth keeps him so late , unless , may be , he can ' t sell his head ."
" Can ' t sell his head ?-- What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me ?"
" Sartain , and that ' s the very reason he can ' t sell it , I guess ."
I come to your house and want a bed ; you tell me you can only give me half a one ; that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer .
This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery , and showed that the landlord , after all , had had no idea of fooling me -- but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath , engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators ?
I can compare it to nothing but a large door mat , ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin .
I remembered a story of a white man -- a whaleman too -- who , falling among the cannibals , had been tattooed by them .
It ' s only his outside ; a man can be honest in any sort of skin .
The next moment the light was extinguished , and this wild cannibal , tomahawk between his teeth , sprang into bed with me .
again growled the cannibal , while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire .
" Stop your grinning ," shouted I , " and why didn ' t you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal ?"
For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean , comely looking cannibal .
Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian .
A pretty pickle , truly , thought I ; abed here in a strange house in the broad day , with a cannibal and a tomahawk !
In these last - mentioned haunts you see only sailors ; but in New Bedford , actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners ; savages outright ; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh .
But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers , cannibals , and bumpkins to show her visitors .
It is a land of oil , true enough : but not like Canaan ; a land , also , of corn and wine .
Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that ?
And in August , high in air , the beautiful and bountiful horse - chestnuts , candelabra - wise , proffer the passer - by their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms .
SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG , WILLIS ELLERY , NATHAN COLEMAN , WALTER CANNY , SETH MACY , AND SAMUEL GLEIG , Forming one of the boats ' crews OF THE SHIP ELIZA Who were towed out of sight by a Whale , On the Off - shore Ground in the PACIFIC , December 31st , 1839 .
ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass ; who standing among flowers can say -- here , HERE lies my beloved ; ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these .
Can it be , then , that by that act of physical isolation , he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time , from all outward worldly ties and connexions ?
" I saw the opening maw of hell , With endless pains and sorrows there ; Which none but they that feel can tell -- Oh , I was plunging to despair .
What a noble thing is that canticle in the fish ' s belly !
Strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent .
In this world , shipmates , sin that pays its way can travel freely , and without a passport ; whereas Virtue , if a pauper , is stopped at all frontiers .
Delight is to him , whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure Keel of the Ages .
And eternal delight and deliciousness will be his , who coming to lay him down , can say with his final breath -- O Father !-- chiefly known to me by Thy rod -- mortal or immortal , here I die .
Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed .
Do you suppose now , Ishmael , that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth -- pagans and all included -- can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood ?
Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed ; as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences , though light be more congenial to our clayey part .
There was excellent blood in his veins -- royal stuff ; though sadly vitiated , I fear , by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth .
As we were going along the people stared ; not at Queequeg so much -- for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets ,-- but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms .
" Look you ," roared the Captain , " I ' ll kill - e YOU , you cannibal , if you try any more of your tricks aboard here ; so mind your eye ."
We cannibals must help these Christians ."
" Queequeg ," said I , " do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam ?"
A cannibal of a craft , tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies .
But as I was going to say , if thou wantest to know what whaling is , as thou tellest ye do , I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it , past backing out .
Can ' t ye see the world where you stand ?"
" Captain Peleg ," said Bildad steadily , " thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water , or ten fathoms , I can ' t tell ; but as thou art still an impenitent man , Captain Peleg , I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one ; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit , Captain Peleg ."
Out of the cabin , ye canting , drab - coloured son of a wooden gun -- a straight wake with ye !"
" Killed more whales than I can count , Captain Peleg ."
Mark ye , be forewarned ; Ahab ' s above the common ; Ahab ' s been in colleges , as well as ' mong the cannibals ; been used to deeper wonders than the waves ; fixed his fiery lance in mightier , stranger foes than whales .
Think of that ; by that sweet girl that old man has a child : hold ye then there can be any utter , hopeless harm in Ahab ?
I wonder , thought I , if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan ; do they fast on their hams that way in his native island .
It can ' t last for ever , thank God , and his Ramadan only comes once a year ; and I don ' t believe it ' s very punctual then .
As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship , Queequeg carrying his harpoon , Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam , saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal , and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft , unless they previously produced their papers .
said Bildad , lifting his eyes and hands , " thou thyself , as I myself , hast seen many a perilous time ; thou knowest , Peleg , what it is to have the fear of death ; how , then , can ' st thou prate in this ungodly guise .
" Ah , my dear fellow , you can ' t fool us that way -- you can ' t fool us .
" There are some sailors running ahead there , if I see right ," said I to Queequeg , " it can ' t be shadows ; she ' s off by sunrise , I guess ; come on !"
Once more we quitted him ; but once more he came softly after us ; and touching my shoulder again , said , " See if you can find ' em now , will ye ?
" Those sailors we saw , Queequeg , where can they have gone to ?"
So to the Jews old Canaan stood , While Jordan rolled between ."
For loath to depart , yet ; very loath to leave , for good , a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage -- beyond both stormy Capes ; a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested ; a ship , in which an old shipmate sailed as captain ; a man almost as old as he , once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw ; loath to say good - bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him ,-- poor old Bildad lingered long ; paced the deck with anxious strides ; ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there ; again came on deck , and looked to windward ; looked towards the wide and endless waters , only bounded by the far - off unseen Eastern Continents ; looked towards the land ; looked aloft ; looked right and left ; looked everywhere and nowhere ; and at last , mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin , convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand , and holding up a lantern , for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face , as much as to say , " Nevertheless , friend Peleg , I can stand it ; yes , I can ."
Can it be , though , that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well , as they anoint machinery ?
As a general rule , he can ' t amount to much in his totality .
What then can it possibly be , but sperm oil in its unmanufactured , unpolluted state , the sweetest of all oils ?
Nor can piety itself , at such a shameful sight , completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars .
Think not , is my eleventh commandment ; and sleep when you can , is my twelfth -- So here goes again .
Remember what I say ; BE kicked by him ; account his kicks honours ; and on no account kick back ; for you can ' t help yourself , wise Stubb .
Well , the best thing you can do , Flask , is to let the old man alone ; never speak to him , whatever he says .
And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted ; and it is the only one that can possibly succeed , for it alone is practicable .
I can say nothing more that is true of ye , nor can the oldest Nantucketer .
If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish , then heaven help ye ; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye .
If any of the following whales , shall hereafter be caught and marked , then he can readily be incorporated into this System , according to his Folio , Octavo , or Duodecimo magnitude :-- The Bottle - Nose Whale ; the Junk Whale ; the Pudding - Headed Whale ; the Cape Whale ; the Leading Whale ; the Cannon Whale ; the Scragg Whale ; the Coppered Whale ; the Elephant Whale ; the Iceberg Whale ; the Quog Whale ; the Blue Whale ; etc .
But I omit them as altogether obsolete ; and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds , full of Leviathanism , but signifying nothing .
For be a man ' s intellectual superiority what it will , it can never assume the practical , available supremacy over other men , without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments , always , in themselves , more or less paltry and base .
This it is , that for ever keeps God ' s true princes of the Empire from the world ' s hustings ; and leaves the highest honours that this air can give , to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert , than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass .
hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals .
You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body , and no more can you make a convenient closet of your watch - coat .
Beware of such an one , I say ; your whales must be seen before they can be killed ; and this sunken - eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes round the world , and never make you one pint of sperm the richer .
How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall ?
Cant them ; cant them over !
This lovely light , it lights not me ; all loveliness is anguish to me , since I can ne ' er enjoy .
Come , Ahab ' s compliments to ye ; come and see if ye can swerve me .
Ah me !-- not thou nor I can bear the change !
But that can ' t be , or else in his one case our old Mogul ' s fire - waters are somewhat long in working .
Here , then , was this grey - headed , ungodly old man , chasing with curses a Job ' s whale round the world , at the head of a crew , too , chiefly made up of mongrel renegades , and castaways , and cannibals -- morally enfeebled also , by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right - mindedness in Starbuck , the invunerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb , and the pervading mediocrity in Flask .
How it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old man ' s ire -- by what evil magic their souls were possessed , that at times his hate seemed almost theirs ; the White Whale as much their insufferable foe as his ; how all this came to be -- what the White Whale was to them , or how to their unconscious understandings , also , in some dim , unsuspected way , he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life ,-- all this to explain , would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go .
The subterranean miner that works in us all , how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting , muffled sound of his pick ?
What skiff in tow of a seventy - four can stand still ?
But how can I hope to explain myself here ; and yet , in some dim , random way , explain myself I must , else all these chapters might be naught .
So that not the fierce - fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white - shrouded bear or shark .
I cannot tell , can only hint , the things that darted through me then .
Nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse , that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly , which so clothed him with divineness ; and that this divineness had that in it which , though commanding worship , at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror .
Therefore , in his other moods , symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness , no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul .
Can we , then , by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness -- though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful , but nevertheless , is found to exert over us the same sorcery , however modified ;-- can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek ?
But in a matter like this , subtlety appeals to subtlety , and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls .
Nor is it , altogether , the remembrance of her cathedral - toppling earthquakes ; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas ; nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain ; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires , wrenched cope - stones , and crosses all adroop ( like canted yards of anchored fleets ); and her suburban avenues of house - walls lying over upon each other , as a tossed pack of cards ;-- it is not these things alone which make tearless Lima , the strangest , saddest city thou can ' st see .
I do not know where I can find a better place than just here , to make mention of one or two other things , which to me seem important , as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the White Whale , more especially the catastrophe .
But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon testimony entirely independent of my own .
The English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head ; and , as for his strength , let me say , that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running sperm whale have , in a calm , been transferred to the ship , and secured there ; the whale towing her great hull through the water , as a horse walks off with a cart .
Even now I am certain that those seas are not , and perhaps never can be , in the present constitution of things , a place for his habitual gregarious resort .
In the Propontis , as far as I can learn , none of that peculiar substance called BRIT is to be found , the aliment of the right whale .
pull , can ' t ye ?
Can ' t be helped !
" I can ' t see three seas off ; tip us up an oar there , and let me on to that ."
Not the raw recruit , marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle ; not the dead man ' s ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other world ;-- neither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does , who for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed , churned circle of the hunted sperm whale .
" Can ' t you twist that smaller ?"
In tempestuous times like these , after everything above and aloft has been secured , nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale .
* The cabin - compass is called the tell - tale , because without going to the compass at the helm , the Captain , while below , can inform himself of the course of the ship .
He is thus completely wedged before and behind , and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs ; but a sudden , violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him , because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth .
Now this Radney , I suppose , was as little of a coward , and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless , unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine , gentlemen .
"' Aye , aye , my merry lads , it ' s a lively leak this ; hold a cannikin , one of ye , and let ' s have a taste .
They ' re playing the devil with his estate , I can tell him .
"' Look ye , now ,' cried the Lakeman , flinging out his arm towards him , ' there are a few of us here ( and I am one of them ) who have shipped for the cruise , d ' ye see ; now as you well know , sir , we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down ; so we don ' t want a row ; it ' s not our interest ; we want to be peaceable ; we are ready to work , but we won ' t be flogged .'
Take that gag from his mouth , and let us hear what he can say for himself .'
"' Excuse me for running after you , Don Sebastian ; but may I also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized Evangelists you can .'
I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas , something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the whale - ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there .
Of course , he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage ( such men seldom have ), but whence he derived that picture , who can tell ?
Though Jeremy Bentham ' s skeleton , which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors , correctly conveys the idea of a burly - browed utilitarian old gentleman , with all Jeremy ' s other leading personal characteristics ; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan ' s articulated bones .
" However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us ," said humorous Stubb one day , " he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens ."
True , one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another , but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness .
And the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour , is by going a whaling yourself ; but by so doing , you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him .
He has but one picture of whaling scenes , and this is a sad deficiency , because it is by such pictures only , when at all well done , that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters .
I myself am a savage , owning no allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals ; and ready at any moment to rebel against him .
Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject , can you fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens , and boats in pursuit of them ; as when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds .
And even when recognised at last , their immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct , in all parts , with the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse .
Indeed , in other respects , you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore .
The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him .
But though , to landsmen in general , the native inhabitants of the seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling ; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita , so that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his one superficial western one ; though , by vast odds , the most terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters ; though but a moment ' s consideration will teach , that however baby man may brag of his science and skill , and however much , in a flattering future , that science and skill may augment ; yet for ever and for ever , to the crack of doom , the sea will insult and murder him , and pulverize the stateliest , stiffest frigate he can make ; nevertheless , by the continual repetition of these very impressions , man has lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it .
Consider , once more , the universal cannibalism of the sea ; all whose creatures prey upon each other , carrying on eternal war since the world began .
For though other species of whales find their food above water , and may be seen by man in the act of feeding , the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface ; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what , precisely , that food consists .
Nor can any son of mortal woman , for the first time , seat himself amid those hempen intricacies , and while straining his utmost at the oar , bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted , and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings ; he cannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly .
It is worse ; for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils , because the boat is rocking like a cradle , and you are pitched one way and the other , without the slightest warning ; and only by a certain self - adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action , can you escape being made a Mazeppa of , and run away with where the all - seeing sun himself could never pierce you out .
A continual cascade played at the bows ; a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake ; and , at the slightest motion from within , even but of a little finger , the vibrating , cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea .
No wonder , taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body , that out of fifty fair chances for a dart , not five are successful ; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated ; no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood - vessels in the boat ; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels ; no wonder that to many ship owners , whaling is but a losing concern ; for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage , and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted !
Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea - fight , sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship ' s decks , like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved , ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them ; and though , while the valiant butchers over the deck - table are thus cannibally carving each other ' s live meat with carving - knives all gilded and tasselled , the sharks , also , with their jewel - hilted mouths , are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat ; and though , were you to turn the whole affair upside down , it would still be pretty much the same thing , that is to say , a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties ; and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic , systematically trotting alongside , to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere , or a dead slave to be decently buried ; and though one or two other like instances might be set down , touching the set terms , places , and occasions , when sharks do most socially congregate , and most hilariously feast ; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless numbers , and in gayer or more jovial spirits , than around a dead sperm whale , moored by night to a whaleship at sea .
Blast me , if I can hear my own voice .
Massa Stubb say dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings , but by Gor !
" Your woraciousness , fellow - critters , I don ' t blame ye so much for ; dat is natur , and can ' t be helped ; but to gobern dat wicked natur , dat is de pint .

Kick up de damndest row as ever you can ; fill your dam bellies ' till dey bust -- and den die ."
They have such an eatable look that the most self - denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off .
And that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf ' s head before him , is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see .
Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal ' s jaw ?
Cannibals ?
who is not a cannibal ?
In most other parts of the ocean , however , where these fish do not so largely abound , their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished , by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling - spades , a procedure notwithstanding , which , in some instances , only seems to tickle them into still greater activity .
In the first place , the enormous cutting tackles , among other ponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green , and which no single man can possibly lift -- this vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to the main - top and firmly lashed to the lower mast - head , the strongest point anywhere above a ship ' s deck .
Now , however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature ' s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness , yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption ; because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale ' s body but that same blubber ; and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal , if reasonably dense , what can that be but the skin ?
Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck ; on the contrary , where his head and body seem to join , there , in that very place , is the thickest part of him .
" Can ' st not read it ?"
is ginger the sort of fuel you use , Dough - boy , to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal ?
But we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it .
For the present other matters press , and the best we can do now for the head , is to pray heaven the tackles may hold .
said Flask , coiling some spare line in the boat ' s bow , " did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale ' s head hoisted on her starboard side , and at the same time a Right Whale ' s on the larboard ; did you never hear , Stubb , that that ship can never afterwards capsize ?"
Stubb , you are skylarking ; how can Fedallah do that ?"
" I think I remember some such story as you were telling ," said Flask , when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship , " but I can ' t remember where ."
And if the devil has a latch - key to get into the admiral ' s cabin , don ' t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole ?
Now , from this peculiar sideway position of the whale ' s eyes , it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead , no more than he can one exactly astern .
Moreover , while in most other animals that I can now think of , the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power , so as to produce one picture and not two to the brain ; the peculiar position of the whale ' s eyes , effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head , which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys ; this , of course , must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts .
Nevertheless , any one ' s experience will teach him , that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance , it is quite impossible for him , attentively , and completely , to examine any two things -- however large or however small -- at one and the same instant of time ; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other .
True , both his eyes , in themselves , must simultaneously act ; but is his brain so much more comprehensive , combining , and subtle than man ' s , that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects , one on one side of him , and the other in an exactly opposite direction ?
If he can , then is it as marvellous a thing in him , as if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in Euclid .
The ear has no external leaf whatever ; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill , so wondrously minute is it .
Let us now with whatever levers and steam - engines we have at hand , cant over the sperm whale ' s head , that it may lie bottom up ; then , ascending by a ladder to the summit , have a peep down the mouth ; and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it , with a lantern we might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach .
Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale ' s there ?
A large whale ' s case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm , though from unavoidable circumstances , considerable of it is spilled , leaks , and dribbles away , or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can .
Only one sweeter end can readily be recalled -- the delicious death of an Ohio honey - hunter , who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree , found such exceeding store of it , that leaning too far over , it sucked him in , so that he died embalmed .
I try all things ; I achieve what I can .
For as in landscape gardening , a spire , cupola , monument , or tower of some sort , is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene ; so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open - work belfry of the nose .
Read it if you can .
As for his true brain , you can then see no indications of it , nor feel any .
And by those negations , considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power , you can best form to yourself the truest , though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is .
" Not that ," said Stubb , " no , no , it ' s a coffee - pot , Mr . Starbuck ; he ' s coming off to make us our coffee , is the Yarman ; don ' t you see that big tin can there alongside of him ?-- that ' s his boiling water .
" Go along with you ," cried Flask , " it ' s a lamp - feeder and an oil - can .
As he mounted the deck , Ahab abruptly accosted him , without at all heeding what he had in his hand ; but in his broken lingo , the German soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale ; immediately turning the conversation to his lamp - feeder and oil can , with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness -- his last drop of Bremen oil being gone , and not a single flying - fish yet captured to supply the deficiency ; concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically called a CLEAN one ( that is , an empty one ), well deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin .
His necessities supplied , Derick departed ; but he had not gained his ship ' s side , when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mast - heads of both vessels ; and so eager for the chase was Derick , that without pausing to put his oil - can and lamp - feeder aboard , he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp - feeders .
At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp - feeder at the advancing boats , and also his oil - can ; perhaps with the double view of retarding his rivals ' way , and at the same time economically accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss .
Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head !
What club but the whaleman ' s can head off like that ?
Nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm , it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage ; considering that oil and water are hostile ; that oil is a sliding thing , and that the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely .
It is furnished with a small rope called a warp , of considerable length , by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting .
Then , Tashtego , lad , I ' d have ye hold a canakin to the jet , and we ' d drink round it !
But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs , like a human being ' s , the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere .
But owing to the mystery of the spout -- whether it be water or whether it be vapour -- no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head .
You have seen him spout ; then declare what the spout is ; can you not tell water from air ?
The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it ; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it , when , always , when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout , he is in a prodigious commotion , the water cascading all around him .
The wisest thing the investigator can do then , it seems to me , is to let this deadly spout alone .
Still , we can hypothesize , even if we cannot prove and establish .
Therein no fairy ' s arm can transcend it .
No ribs of man or boat can withstand it .
Two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together , so that they cross each other ' s grain at right angles ; a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block , and the other end of the line being looped , it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon .
For then , more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time .
But sperm whales are not every day encountered ; while you may , then , you must kill all you can .
And if you cannot kill them all at once , you must wing them , so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure .
A Loose - Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it .
The truth is , that living or dead , if but decently treated , whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor ; nor can whalemen be recognised , as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company , by the nose .
Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant , when , as a general thing , he enjoys such high health ; taking abundance of exercise ; always out of doors ; though , it is true , seldom in the open air .
We can ' t afford to lose whales by the likes of you ; a whale would sell for thirty times what you would , Pip , in Alabama .
who can tell it ?
This spade is sharp as hone can make it ; the spademan ' s feet are shoeless ; the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him , like a sledge .
So the pitch and sulphur - freighted brigs of the bold Hydriote , Canaris , issuing from their midnight harbors , with broad sheets of flame for sails , bore down upon the Turkish frigates , and folded them in conflagrations .
And there is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges , and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces .
While still warm , the oil , like hot punch , is received into the six - barrel casks ; and while , perhaps , the ship is pitching and rolling this way and that in the midnight sea , the enormous casks are slewed round and headed over , end for end , and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery deck , like so many land slides , till at last man - handled and stayed in their course ; and all round the hoops , rap , rap , go as many hammers as can play upon them , for now , EX OFFICIO , every sailor is a cooper .
" No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold , but devil ' s claws must have left their mouldings there since yesterday ," murmured Starbuck to himself , leaning against the bulwarks .
I ' ll get the almanac and as I have heard devils can be raised with Daboll ' s arithmetic , I ' ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar .
What says the Cannibal ?
I can stand the rest , for they have plain wits ; but he ' s too crazy - witty for my sanity .
let us shake bones together !-- an arm and a leg !-- an arm that never can shrink , d ' ye see ; and a leg that never can run .
" No , thank ye , Bunger ," said the English Captain , " he ' s welcome to the arm he has , since I can ' t help it , and didn ' t know him then ; but not to another one .
But why was it , think ye , that the Samuel Enderby , and some other English whalers I know of -- not all though -- were such famous , hospitable ships ; that passed round the beef , and the bread , and the can , and the joke ; and were not soon weary of eating , and drinking , and laughing ?
For , say they , when cruising in an empty ship , if you can get nothing better out of the world , get a good dinner out of it , at least .
Can you land a full - grown whale on your deck for examination , as a cook dishes a roast - pig ?
Because there are skeleton authorities you can refer to , to test my accuracy .
Sir Clifford ' s whale has been articulated throughout ; so that , like a great chest of drawers , you can open and shut him , in all his bony cavities -- spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan -- and swing all day upon his lower jaw .
Only in the heart of quickest perils ; only when within the eddyings of his angry flukes ; only on the profound unbounded sea , can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out .
For that , the best way we can consider it is , with a crane , to pile its bones high up on end .
I was told that there were still smaller ones , but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins , the priest ' s children , who had stolen them to play marbles with .
No great and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea , though many there be who have tried it .
When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons , skulls , tusks , jaws , ribs , and vertebrae , all characterized by partial resemblances to the existing breeds of sea - monsters ; but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical Leviathans , their incalculable seniors ; I am , by a flood , borne back to that wondrous period , ere time itself can be said to have begun ; for time began with man .
Who can show a pedigree like Leviathan ?
The Common People imagine , that by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the temple , no Whale can pass it without immediate death .
Whether owing to the almost omniscient look - outs at the mast - heads of the whaleships , now penetrating even through Behring ' s straits , and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world ; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts ; the moot point is , whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a chase , and so remorseless a havoc ; whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters , and the last whale , like the last man , smoke his last pipe , and then himself evaporate in the final puff .
And as upon the invasion of their valleys , the frosty Swiss have retreated to their mountains ; so , hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas , the whale - bone whales can at last resort to their Polar citadels , and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there , come up among icy fields and floes ; and in a charmed circle of everlasting December , bid defiance to all pursuit from man .
No fear ; I like a good grip ; I like to feel something in this slippery world that can hold , man .
Yet I don ' t stop to plug my leak ; for who can find it in the deep - loaded hull ; or how hope to plug it , even if found , in this life ' s howling gale ?
" Because I am scorched all over , Captain Ahab ," answered Perth , resting for a moment on his hammer ; " I am past scorching ; not easily can ' st thou scorch a scar ."
How can ' st thou endure without being mad ?
Do the heavens yet hate thee , that thou can ' st not go mad ?-- What wert thou making there ?"
" And can ' st thou make it all smooth again , blacksmith , after such hard usage as it had ?"
" And I suppose thou can ' st smoothe almost any seams and dents ; never mind how hard the metal , blacksmith ?"
" Aye , sir , I think I can ; all seams and dents but one ."
" Look ye here , then ," cried Ahab , passionately advancing , and leaning with both hands on Perth ' s shoulders ; " look ye here -- HERE -- can ye smoothe out a seam like this , blacksmith ," sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow ; " if thou could ' st , blacksmith , glad enough would I lay my head upon thy anvil , and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes .
Can ' st thou smoothe this seam ?"
" Loveliness unfathomable , as ever lover saw in his young bride ' s eye !-- Tell me not of thy teeth - tiered sharks , and thy kidnapping cannibal ways .
Have I not said , old man , that neither hearse nor coffin can be thine ?"
" And when thou art so gone before -- if that ever befall -- then ere I can follow , thou must still appear to me , to pilot me still ?-- Was it not so ?
" Take another pledge , old man ," said the Parsee , as his eyes lighted up like fire - flies in the gloom --" Hemp only can kill thee ."
Stubb , for one , can ' t fight it .
how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else , never mind how foolish ?"
" The gale that now hammers at us to stave us , we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home .
Thou canst blind ; but I can then grope .
Thou canst consume ; but I can then be ashes .
First take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here , though , so I can pass the rope ; now listen .
Don ' t you see , you timber - head , that no harm can come to the holder of the rod , unless the mast is first struck ?
any man with half an eye can be sensible ."
It was thus with the Pequod ' s ; at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards ; it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion .
I can ' t withstand thee , then , old man .
boy !-- But if I wake thee not to death , old man , who can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck ' s body this day week may sink , with all the crew !
" Men ," said he , steadily turning upon the crew , as the mate handed him the things he had demanded , " my men , the thunder turned old Ahab ' s needles ; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own , that will point as true as any ."
But Ahab can mend all .
" There can be no hearts above the snow - line .
" It will make a good enough one ," said Flask , " the carpenter here can arrange it easily ."
The whole he can endure ; at the parts he baulks .
We work by the month , or by the job , or by the profit ; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work , unless it be too confounded cobbling , and then we stash it if we can .
Can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is , after all , but an immortality - preserver !
But the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel , for a moment , the cankerous thing in his soul .
About this time -- yes , it is his noon nap now -- the boy vivaciously wakes ; sits up in bed ; and his mother tells him of me , of cannibal old me ; how I am abroad upon the deep , but will yet come back to dance him again ."
But if the great sun move not of himself ; but is as an errand - boy in heaven ; nor one single star can revolve , but by some invisible power ; how then can this one small heart beat ; this one small brain think thoughts ; unless God does that beating , does that thinking , does that living , and not I .
" Can ' t see the spout now , sir ;-- too dark "-- cried a voice from the air .
cried Stubb , " I knew it -- ye can ' t escape -- blow on and split your spout , O whale !
Nor white whale , nor man , nor fiend , can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being .
Can any lead touch yonder floor , any mast scrape yonder roof ?-- Aloft there !
I can ' t compare with it ; and I ' ve known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital fathers .
ye but strike a thing without a lid ; and no coffin and no hearse can be mine :-- and hemp only can kill me !
those boats are useless now ; repair them if ye can in time , and return to me ; if not , Ahab is enough to die -- Down , men !
pull on !-- But who can tell "-- he muttered --" whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on Ahab ?-- But pull on !
As both steel and curse sank to the socket , as if sucked into a morass , Moby Dick sideways writhed ; spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow , and , without staving a hole in it , so suddenly canted the boat over , that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung , Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea .
and since neither can be mine , let me then tow to pieces , while still chasing thee , though tied to thee , thou damned whale !
A dungeon horrible , on all sides round , As one great furnace flamed ; yet from those flames No light ; but rather darkness visible Served only to discover sights of woe , Regions of sorrow , doleful shades , where peace And rest can never dwell , hope never comes That comes to all , but torture without end Still urges , and a fiery deluge , fed With ever - burning sulphur unconsumed .
Yet not for those , Nor what the potent Victor in his rage Can else inflict , do I repent , or change , Though changed in outward lustre , that fixed mind , And high disdain from sense of injured merit , That with the Mightiest raised me to contend , And to the fierce contentions brought along Innumerable force of Spirits armed , That durst dislike his reign , and , me preferring , His utmost power with adverse power opposed In dubious battle on the plains of Heaven , And shook his throne .
So spake th ' apostate Angel , though in pain , Vaunting aloud , but racked with deep despair ; And him thus answered soon his bold compeer :-- " O Prince , O Chief of many throned Powers That led th ' embattled Seraphim to war Under thy conduct , and , in dreadful deeds Fearless , endangered Heaven ' s perpetual King , And put to proof his high supremacy , Whether upheld by strength , or chance , or fate , Too well I see and rue the dire event That , with sad overthrow and foul defeat , Hath lost us Heaven , and all this mighty host In horrible destruction laid thus low , As far as Gods and heavenly Essences Can perish : for the mind and spirit remains Invincible , and vigour soon returns , Though all our glory extinct , and happy state Here swallowed up in endless misery .
What can it the avail though yet we feel Strength undiminished , or eternal being To undergo eternal punishment ?"
Thither let us tend From off the tossing of these fiery waves ; There rest , if any rest can harbour there ; And , re - assembling our afflicted powers , Consult how we may henceforth most offend Our enemy , our own loss how repair , How overcome this dire calamity , What reinforcement we may gain from hope , If not , what resolution from despair ."
Be it so , since he Who now is sovereign can dispose and bid What shall be right : farthest from him is best Whom reason hath equalled , force hath made supreme Above his equals .
The mind is its own place , and in itself Can make a Heaven of Hell , a Hell of Heaven .
He called so loud that all the hollow deep Of Hell resounded :--" Princes , Potentates , Warriors , the Flower of Heaven -- once yours ; now lost , If such astonishment as this can seize Eternal Spirits !
For Spirits , when they please , Can either sex assume , or both ; so soft And uncompounded is their essence pure , Not tried or manacled with joint or limb , Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones , Like cumbrous flesh ; but , in what shape they choose , Dilated or condensed , bright or obscure , Can execute their airy purposes , And works of love or enmity fulfil .
For who can yet believe , though after loss , That all these puissant legions , whose exile Hath emptied Heaven , shall fail to re - ascend , Self - raised , and repossess their native seat ?
Peace is despaired ; For who can think submission ?
High on a throne of royal state , which far Outshone the wealth or Ormus and of Ind , Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold , Satan exalted sat , by merit raised To that bad eminence ; and , from despair Thus high uplifted beyond hope , aspires Beyond thus high , insatiate to pursue Vain war with Heaven ; and , by success untaught , His proud imaginations thus displayed :-- " Powers and Dominions , Deities of Heaven !-- For , since no deep within her gulf can hold Immortal vigour , though oppressed and fallen , I give not Heaven for lost : from this descent Celestial Virtues rising will appear More glorious and more dread than from no fall , And trust themselves to fear no second fate !-- Me though just right , and the fixed laws of Heaven , Did first create your leader -- next , free choice With what besides in council or in fight Hath been achieved of merit -- yet this loss , Thus far at least recovered , hath much more Established in a safe , unenvied throne , Yielded with full consent .
Where there is , then , no good For which to strive , no strife can grow up there From faction : for none sure will claim in Hell Precedence ; none whose portion is so small Of present pain that with ambitious mind Will covet more !
With this advantage , then , To union , and firm faith , and firm accord , More than can be in Heaven , we now return To claim our just inheritance of old , Surer to prosper than prosperity Could have assured us ; and by what best way , Whether of open war or covert guile , We now debate .
Who can advise may speak ."
What can be worse Than to dwell here , driven out from bliss , condemned In this abhorred deep to utter woe !
And who knows , Let this be good , whether our angry Foe Can give it , or will ever ?
How he can Is doubtful ; that he never will is sure .
Say they who counsel war ; ' we are decreed , Reserved , and destined to eternal woe ; Whatever doing , what can we suffer more , What can we suffer worse ?'
War , therefore , open or concealed , alike My voice dissuades ; for what can force or guile With him , or who deceive his mind , whose eye Views all things at one view ?
This is now Our doom ; which if we can sustain and bear , Our Supreme Foe in time may much remit His anger , and perhaps , thus far removed , Not mind us not offending , satisfied With what is punished ; whence these raging fires Will slacken , if his breath stir not their flames .
The former , vain to hope , argues as vain The latter ; for what place can be for us Within Heaven ' s bound , unless Heaven ' s Lord supreme We overpower ?
Our greatness will appear Then most conspicuous when great things of small , Useful of hurtful , prosperous of adverse , We can create , and in what place soe ' er Thrive under evil , and work ease out of pain Through labour and endurance .
This desert soil Wants not her hidden lustre , gems and gold ; Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise Magnificence ; and what can Heaven show more ?
and what peace can we return , But , to our power , hostility and hate , Untamed reluctance , and revenge , though slow , Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least May reap his conquest , and may least rejoice In doing what we most in suffering feel ?
What strength , what art , can then Suffice , or what evasion bear him safe , Through the strict senteries and stations thick Of Angels watching round ?
Down they fell , Driven headlong from the pitch of Heaven , down Into this Deep ; and in the general fall I also : at which time this powerful key Into my hands was given , with charge to keep These gates for ever shut , which none can pass Without my opening .
But thou , O father , I forewarn thee , shun His deadly arrow ; neither vainly hope To be invulnerable in those bright arms , Through tempered heavenly ; for that mortal dint , Save he who reigns above , none can resist ."
I upon my frontiers here Keep residence ; if all I can will serve That little which is left so to defend , Encroached on still through our intestine broils Weakening the sceptre of old Night : first , Hell , Your dungeon , stretching far and wide beneath ; Now lately Heaven and Earth , another world Hung o ' er my realm , linked in a golden chain To that side Heaven from whence your legions fell !
whom no bounds Prescrib ' d no bars of Hell , nor all the chains Heap ' d on him there , nor yet the main abyss Wide interrupt , can hold ; so bent he seems On desperate revenge , that shall redound Upon his own rebellious head .
And now , Through all restraint broke loose , he wings his way Not far off Heaven , in the precincts of light , Directly towards the new created world , And man there plac ' d , with purpose to assay If him by force he can destroy , or , worse , By some false guile pervert ; and shall pervert ; For man will hearken to his glozing lies , And easily transgress the sole command , Sole pledge of his obedience : So will fall He and his faithless progeny : Whose fault ?
they therefore , as to right belong $ ' d , So were created , nor can justly accuse Their Maker , or their making , or their fate , As if predestination over - rul ' d Their will dispos ' d by absolute decree Or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed Their own revolt , not I ; if I foreknew , Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault , Which had no less proved certain unforeknown .
Happy for Man , so coming ; he her aid Can never seek , once dead in sins , and lost ; Atonement for himself , or offering meet , Indebted and undone , hath none to bring ; Behold me then : me for him , life for life I offer : on me let thine anger fall ; Account me Man ; I for his sake will leave Thy bosom , and this glory next to thee Freely put off , and for him lastly die Well pleased ; on me let Death wreak all his rage .
Thou hast given me to possess Life in myself for ever ; by thee I live ; Though now to Death I yield , and am his due , All that of me can die , yet , that debt paid , $ thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave His prey , nor suffer my unspotted soul For ever with corruption there to dwell ; But I shall rise victorious , and subdue My vanquisher , spoiled of his vaunted spoil .
Thee next they sang of all creation first , Begotten Son , Divine Similitude , In whose conspicuous countenance , without cloud Made visible , the Almighty Father shines , Whom else no creature can behold ; on thee Impressed the effulgence of his glory abides , Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests .
As when a vultur on Imaus bred , Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds , Dislodging from a region scarce of prey To gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids , On hills where flocks are fed , flies toward the springs Of Ganges or Hydaspes , Indian streams ; But in his way lights on the barren plains Of Sericana , where Chineses drive With sails and wind their cany waggons light : So , on this windy sea of land , the Fiend Walked up and down alone , bent on his prey ; Alone , for other creature in this place , Living or lifeless , to be found was none ; None yet , but store hereafter from the earth Up hither like aereal vapours flew Of all things transitory and vain , when sin With vanity had filled the works of men : Both all things vain , and all who in vain things Built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame , Or happiness in this or the other life ; All who have their reward on earth , the fruits Of painful superstition and blind zeal , Nought seeking but the praise of men , here find Fit retribution , empty as their deeds ; All the unaccomplished works of Nature ' s hand , Abortive , monstrous , or unkindly mixed , Dissolved on earth , fleet hither , and in vain , Till final dissolution , wander here ; Not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed ; Those argent fields more likely habitants , Translated Saints , or middle Spirits hold Betwixt the angelical and human kind .
Here matter new to gaze the Devil met Undazzled ; far and wide his eye commands ; For sight no obstacle found here , nor shade , But all sun - shine , as when his beams at noon Culminate from the equator , as they now Shot upward still direct , whence no way round Shadow from body opaque can fall ; and the air , No where so clear , sharpened his visual ray To objects distant far , whereby he soon Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand , The same whom John saw also in the sun : His back was turned , but not his brightness hid ; Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar Circled his head , nor less his locks behind Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings Lay waving round ; on some great charge employed He seemed , or fixed in cogitation deep .
So spake the false dissembler unperceived ; For neither Man nor Angel can discern Hypocrisy , the only evil that walks Invisible , except to God alone , By his permissive will , through Heaven and Earth : And oft , though wisdom wake , suspicion sleeps At wisdom ' s gate , and to simplicity Resigns her charge , while goodness thinks no ill Where no ill seems : Which now for once beguiled Uriel , though regent of the sun , and held The sharpest - sighted Spirit of all in Heaven ; Who to the fraudulent impostor foul , In his uprightness , answer thus returned .
Fair Angel , thy desire , which tends to know The works of God , thereby to glorify The great Work - master , leads to no excess That reaches blame , but rather merits praise The more it seems excess , that led thee hither From thy empyreal mansion thus alone , To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps , Contented with report , hear only in Heaven : For wonderful indeed are all his works , Pleasant to know , and worthiest to be all Had in remembrance always with delight ; But what created mind can comprehend Their number , or the wisdom infinite That brought them forth , but hid their causes deep ?
that now , While time was , our first parents had been warned The coming of their secret foe , and ' scaped , Haply so ' scaped his mortal snare : For now Satan , now first inflamed with rage , came down , The tempter ere the accuser of mankind , To wreak on innocent frail Man his loss Of that first battle , and his flight to Hell : Yet , not rejoicing in his speed , though bold Far off and fearless , nor with cause to boast , Begins his dire attempt ; which nigh the birth Now rolling boils in his tumultuous breast , And like a devilish engine back recoils Upon himself ; horrour and doubt distract His troubled thoughts , and from the bottom stir The Hell within him ; for within him Hell He brings , and round about him , nor from Hell One step , no more than from himself , can fly By change of place : Now conscience wakes despair , That slumbered ; wakes the bitter memory Of what he was , what is , and what must be Worse ; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue .
For never can true reconcilement grow , Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep : Which would but lead me to a worse relapse And heavier fall : so should I purchase dear Short intermission bought with double smart .
Sole partner , and sole part , of all these joys , Dearer thyself than all ; needs must the Power That made us , and for us this ample world , Be infinitely good , and of his good As liberal and free as infinite ; That raised us from the dust , and placed us here In all this happiness , who at his hand Have nothing merited , nor can perform Aught whereof he hath need ; he who requires From us no other service than to keep This one , this easy charge , of all the trees In Paradise that bear delicious fruit So various , not to taste that only tree Of knowledge , planted by the tree of life ; So near grows death to life , whate ' er death is , Some dreadful thing no doubt ; for well thou knowest God hath pronounced it death to taste that tree , The only sign of our obedience left , Among so many signs of power and rule Conferred upon us , and dominion given Over all other creatures that possess Earth , air , and sea .
Can it be sin to know ?
Can it be death ?
hence I will excite their minds With more desire to know , and to reject Envious commands , invented with design To keep them low , whom knowledge might exalt Equal with Gods : aspiring to be such , They taste and die : What likelier can ensue But first with narrow search I must walk round This garden , and no corner leave unspied ; A chance but chance may lead where I may meet Some wandering Spirit of Heaven by fountain side , Or in thick shade retired , from him to draw What further would be learned .
Him thus intent Ithuriel with his spear Touched lightly ; for no falshood can endure Touch of celestial temper , but returns Of force to its own likeness : Up he starts Discovered and surprised .
Thy fear , said Zephon bold , Will save us trial what the least can do Single against thee wicked , and thence weak .
till the wrath , Which thou incurrest by flying , meet thy flight Sevenfold , and scourge that wisdom back to Hell , Which taught thee yet no better , that no pain Can equal anger infinite provoked .
Satan , I know thy strength , and thou knowest mine ; Neither our own , but given : What folly then To boast what arms can do ?
Best image of myself , and dearer half , The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep Affects me equally ; nor can I like This uncouth dream , of evil sprung , I fear ; Yet evil whence ?
in thee can harbour none , Created pure .
Speak , ye who best can tell , ye sons of light , Angels ; for ye behold him , and with songs And choral symphonies , day without night , Circle his throne rejoicing ; ye in Heaven On Earth join all ye Creatures to extol Him first , him last , him midst , and without end .
Native of Heaven , for other place None can than Heaven such glorious shape contain ; Since , by descending from the thrones above , Those happy places thou hast deigned a while To want , and honour these , vouchsafe with us Two only , who yet by sovran gift possess This spacious ground , in yonder shady bower To rest ; and what the garden choicest bears To sit and taste , till this meridian heat Be over , and the sun more cool decline .
So down they sat , And to their viands fell ; nor seemingly The Angel , nor in mist , the common gloss Of Theologians ; but with keen dispatch Of real hunger , and concoctive heat To transubstantiate : What redounds , transpires Through Spirits with ease ; nor wonder ; if by fire Of sooty coal the empirick alchemist Can turn , or holds it possible to turn , Metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold , As from the mine .
Mean while enjoy Your fill what happiness this happy state Can comprehend , incapable of more .
Can we want obedience then To him , or possibly his love desert , Who formed us from the dust and placed us here Full to the utmost measure of what bliss Human desires can seek or apprehend ?
God made thee perfect , not immutable ; And good he made thee , but to persevere He left it in thy power ; ordained thy will By nature free , not over - ruled by fate Inextricable , or strict necessity : Our voluntary service he requires , Not our necessitated ; such with him Finds no acceptance , nor can find ; for how Can hearts , not free , be tried whether they serve Willing or no , who will but what they must By destiny , and can no other choose ?
What sleep can close Thy eye - lids ?
Thou to me thy thoughts Wast wont , I mine to thee was wont to impart ; Both waking we were one ; how then can now Thy sleep dissent ?
Who can in reason then , or right , assume Monarchy over such as live by right His equals , if in power and splendour less , In freedom equal ?
or can introduce Law and edict on us , who without law Err not ?
Then who created thee lamenting learn , When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know .
to receive Thy merited reward , the first assay Of this right hand provoked , since first that tongue , Inspired with contradiction , durst oppose A third part of the Gods , in synod met Their deities to assert ; who , while they feel Vigour divine within them , can allow Omnipotence to none .
They ended parle , and both addressed for fight Unspeakable ; for who , though with the tongue Of Angels , can relate , or to what things Liken on earth conspicuous , that may lift Human imagination to such highth Of Godlike power ?
Yet soon he healed ; for Spirits that live throughout Vital in every part , not as frail man In entrails , heart of head , liver or reins , Cannot but by annihilating die ; Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound Receive , no more than can the fluid air : All heart they live , all head , all eye , all ear , All intellect , all sense ; and , as they please , They limb themselves , and colour , shape , or size Assume , as ? kikes them best , condense or rare .
Of evil then so small as easy think The remedy ; perhaps more valid arms , Weapons more violent , when next we meet , May serve to better us , and worse our foes , Or equal what between us made the odds , In nature none : If other hidden cause Left them superiour , while we can preserve Unhurt our minds , and understanding sound , Due search and consultation will disclose .
He , who therefore can invent With what more forcible we may offend Our yet unwounded enemies , or arm Ourselves with like defence , to me deserves No less than for deliverance what we owe .
two days are past , Two days , as we compute the days of Heaven , Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame These disobedient : Sore hath been their fight , As likeliest was , when two such foes met armed ; For to themselves I left them ; and thou knowest , Equal in their creation they were formed , Save what sin hath impaired ; which yet hath wrought Insensibly , for I suspend their doom ; Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last Endless , and no solution will be found : War wearied hath performed what war can do , And to disordered rage let loose the reins With mountains , as with weapons , armed ; which makes Wild work in Heaven , and dangerous to the main .
Two days are therefore past , the third is thine ; For thee I have ordained it ; and thus far Have suffered , that the glory may be thine Of ending this great war , since none but Thou Can end it .
Scepter and power , thy giving , I assume , And gladlier shall resign , when in the end Thou shalt be all in all , and I in thee For ever ; and in me all whom thou lovest : But whom thou hatest , I hate , and can put on Thy terrours , as I put thy mildness on , Image of thee in all things ; and shall soon , Armed with thy might , rid Heaven of these rebelled ; To their prepared ill mansion driven down , To chains of darkness , and the undying worm ; That from thy just obedience could revolt , Whom to obey is happiness entire .
And the great light of day yet wants to run Much of his race though steep ; suspense in Heaven , Held by thy voice , thy potent voice , he hears , And longer will delay to hear thee tell His generation , and the rising birth Of Nature from the unapparent Deep : Or if the star of evening and the moon Haste to thy audience , Night with her will bring , Silence ; and Sleep , listening to thee , will watch ; Or we can bid his absence , till thy song End , and dismiss thee ere the morning shine .
This also thy request , with caution asked , Obtain ; though to recount almighty works What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice , Or heart of man suffice to comprehend ?
At least our envious Foe hath failed , who thought All like himself rebellious , by whose aid This inaccessible high strength , the seat Of Deity supreme , us dispossessed , He trusted to have seised , and into fraud Drew many , whom their place knows here no more : Yet far the greater part have kept , I see , Their station ; Heaven , yet populous , retains Number sufficient to possess her realms Though wide , and this high temple to frequent With ministeries due , and solemn rites : But , lest his heart exalt him in the harm Already done , to have dispeopled Heaven , My damage fondly deemed , I can repair That detriment , if such it be to lose Self - lost ; and in a moment will create Another world , out of one man a race Of men innumerable , there to dwell , Not here ; till , by degrees of merit raised , They open to themselves at length the way Up hither , under long obedience tried ; And Earth be changed to Heaven , and Heaven to Earth , One kingdom , joy and union without end .
Immediate are the acts of God , more swift Than time or motion , but to human ears Cannot without process of speech be told , So told as earthly notion can receive .
what thought can measure thee , or tongue Relate thee !
Who can impair thee , Mighty King , or bound Thy empire !
Something yet of doubt remains , Which only thy solution can resolve .
In solitude What happiness , who can enjoy alone , Or , all enjoying , what contentment find ?
Among unequals what society Can sort , what harmony , or true delight ?
Which must be mutual , in proportion due Given and received ; but , in disparity The one intense , the other still remiss , Cannot well suit with either , but soon prove Tedious alike : Of fellowship I speak Such as I seek , fit to participate All rational delight : wherein the brute Cannot be human consort : They rejoice Each with their kind , lion with lioness ; So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined : Much less can bird with beast , or fish with fowl So well converse , nor with the ox the ape ; Worse then can man with beast , and least of all .
But I can now no more ; the parting sun Beyond the Earth ' s green Cape and verdant Isles Hesperian sets , my signal to depart .
00482129 If answerable style I can obtain Of my celestial patroness , who deigns Her nightly visitation unimplor ' d , And dictates to me slumbering ; or inspires Easy my unpremeditated verse : Since first this subject for heroick song Pleas ' d me long choosing , and beginning late ; Not sedulous by nature to indite Wars , hitherto the only argument Heroick deem ' d chief mastery to dissect With long and tedious havock fabled knights In battles feign ' d ; the better fortitude Of patience and heroick martyrdom Unsung ; or to describe races and games , Or tilting furniture , imblazon ' d shields , Impresses quaint , caparisons and steeds , Bases and tinsel trappings , gorgeous knights At joust and tournament ; then marshall ' d feast Serv ' d up in hall with sewers and seneshals ; The skill of artifice or office mean , Not that which justly gives heroick name To person , or to poem .
Well hast thou motioned , well thy thoughts employed , How we might best fulfil the work which here God hath assigned us ; nor of me shalt pass Unpraised : for nothing lovelier can be found In woman , than to study houshold good , And good works in her husband to promote .
His violence thou fearest not , being such As we , not capable of death or pain , Can either not receive , or can repel .
His fraud is then thy fear ; which plain infers Thy equal fear , that my firm faith and love Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced ; Thoughts , which how found they harbour in thy breast , Adam , mis - thought of her to thee so dear ?
O Woman , best are all things as the will Of God ordained them : His creating hand Nothing imperfect or deficient left Of all that he created , much less Man , Or aught that might his happy state secure , Secure from outward force ; within himself The danger lies , yet lies within his power : Against his will he can receive no harm .
Wouldst thou approve thy constancy , approve First thy obedience ; the other who can know , Not seeing thee attempted , who attest ?
Empress , the way is ready , and not long ; Beyond a row of myrtles , on a flat , Fast by a fountain , one small thicket past Of blowing myrrh and balm : if thou accept My conduct , I can bring thee thither soon Lead then , said Eve .
So ye shall die perhaps , by putting off Human , to put on Gods ; death to be wished , Though threatened , which no worse than this can bring .
What can your knowledge hurt him , or this tree Impart against his will , if all be his ?
and can envy dwell In heavenly breasts ?
But strange Hath been the cause , and wonderful to hear : This tree is not , as we are told , a tree Of danger tasted , nor to evil unknown Opening the way , but of divine effect To open eyes , and make them Gods who taste ; And hath been tasted such : The serpent wise , Or not restrained as we , or not obeying , Hath eaten of the fruit ; and is become , Not dead , as we are threatened , but thenceforth Endued with human voice and human sense , Reasoning to admiration ; and with me Persuasively hath so prevailed , that I Have also tasted , and have also found The effects to correspond ; opener mine eyes , Dim erst , dilated spirits , ampler heart , And growing up to Godhead ; which for thee Chiefly I sought , without thee can despise .
O fairest of Creation , last and best Of all God ' s works , Creature in whom excelled Whatever can to sight or thought be formed , Holy , divine , good , amiable , or sweet !
Some cursed fraud Of enemy hath beguiled thee , yet unknown , And me with thee hath ruined ; for with thee Certain my resolution is to die : How can I live without thee !
But past who can recall , or done undo ?
Nor can I think that God , Creator wise , Though threatening , will in earnest so destroy Us his prime creatures , dignified so high , Set over all his works ; which in our fall , For us created , needs with us must fail , Dependant made ; so God shall uncreate , Be frustrate , do , undo , and labour lose ; Not well conceived of God , who , though his power Creation could repeat , yet would be loth Us to abolish , lest the Adversary Triumph , and say ; " Fickle their state whom God " Most favours ; who can please him long ?
Mean while the heinous and despiteful act Of Satan , done in Paradise ; and how He , in the serpent , had perverted Eve , Her husband she , to taste the fatal fruit , Was known in Heaven ; for what can ' scape the eye Of God all - seeing , or deceive his heart Omniscient ?
It cannot be But that success attends him ; if mishap , Ere this he had returned , with fury driven By his avengers ; since no place like this Can fit his punishment , or their revenge .
Thou , my shade Inseparable , must with me along ; For Death from Sin no power can separate .
Nor can I miss the way , so strongly drawn By this new - felt attraction and instinct .
He ended , and the heavenly audience loud Sung Halleluiah , as the sound of seas , Through multitude that sung : Just are thy ways , Righteous are thy decrees on all thy works ; Who can extenuate thee ?
for what can I encrease , Or multiply , but curses on my head ?
How can he exercise Wrath without end on Man , whom death must end ?
Can he make deathless death ?
But from me what can proceed , But all corrupt ; both mind and will depraved Not to do only , but to will the same With me ?
How can they then acquitted stand In sight of God ?
Adam , by sad experiment I know How little weight my words with thee can find , Found so erroneous ; thence by just event Found so unfortunate : Nevertheless , Restored by thee , vile as I am , to place Of new acceptance , hopeful to regain Thy love , the sole contentment of my heart Living or dying , from thee I will not hide What thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen , Tending to some relief of our extremes , Or end ; though sharp and sad , yet tolerable , As in our evils , and of easier choice .
What better can we do , than , to the place Repairing where he judged us , prostrate fall Before him reverent ; and there confess Humbly our faults , and pardon beg ; with tears Watering the ground , and with our sighs the air Frequenting , sent from hearts contrite , in sign Of sorrow unfeigned , and humiliation meek
But the field To labour calls us , now with sweat imposed , Though after sleepless night ; for see ! the morn , All unconcerned with our unrest , begins Her rosy progress smiling : let us forth ; I never from thy side henceforth to stray , Where ' er our day ' s work lies , though now enjoined Laborious , till day droop ; while here we dwell , What can be toilsome in these pleasant walks ?
gently hast thou told Thy message , which might else in telling wound , And in performing end us ; what besides Of sorrow , and dejection , and despair , Our frailty can sustain , thy tidings bring , Departure from this happy place , our sweet Recess , and only consolation left Familiar to our eyes !
all places else Inhospitable appear , and desolate ; Nor knowing us , nor known : And , if by prayer Incessant I could hope to change the will Of Him who all things can , I would not cease To weary him with my assiduous cries : But prayer against his absolute decree No more avails than breath against the wind , Blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth : Therefore to his great bidding I submit .
His eye might there command wherever stood City of old or modern fame , the seat Of mightiest empire , from the destined walls Of Cambalu , seat of Cathaian Can , And Samarchand by Oxus , Temir ' s throne , To Paquin of Sinaean kings ; and thence To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul , Down to the golden Chersonese ; or where The Persian in Ecbatan sat , or since In Hispahan ; or where the Russian Ksar In Mosco ; or the Sultan in Bizance , Turchestan - born ; nor could his eye not ken The empire of Negus to his utmost port Ercoco , and the less maritim kings Mombaza , and Quiloa , and Melind , And Sofala , thought Ophir , to the realm Of Congo , and Angola farthest south ; Or thence from Niger flood to Atlas mount The kingdoms of Almansor , Fez and Sus , Morocco , and Algiers , and Tremisen ; On Europe thence , and where Rome was to sway The world : in spirit perhaps he also saw Rich Mexico , the seat of Montezume , And Cusco in Peru , the richer seat Of Atabalipa ; and yet unspoiled Guiana , whose great city Geryon ' s sons Call El Dorado .
Can thus The image of God in Man , created once So goodly and erect , though faulty since , To such unsightly sufferings be debased Under inhuman pains ?
Let no man seek Henceforth to be foretold , what shall befall Him or his children ; evil he may be sure , Which neither his foreknowing can prevent ; And he the future evil shall no less In apprehension than in substance feel , Grievous to bear : but that care now is past , Man is not whom to warn : those few escaped Famine and anguish will at last consume , Wandering that watery desart : I had hope , When violence was ceased , and war on earth , All would have then gone well ; peace would have crowned With length of happy days the race of Man ; But I was far deceived ; for now I see Peace to corrupt no less than war to waste .
The conquered also , and enslaved by war , Shall , with their freedom lost , all virtue lose And fear of God ; from whom their piety feigned In sharp contest of battle found no aid Against invaders ; therefore , cooled in zeal , Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure , Worldly or dissolute , on what their lords Shall leave them to enjoy ; for the earth shall bear More than enough , that temperance may be tried : So all shall turn degenerate , all depraved ; Justice and temperance , truth and faith , forgot ; One man except , the only son of light In a dark age , against example good , Against allurement , custom , and a world Offended : fearless of reproach and scorn , The grand - child , with twelve sons encreased , departs From Canaan , to a land hereafter called Egypt , divided by the river Nile ; See where it flows , disgorging at seven mouths Into the sea : To sojourn in that land He comes , invited by a younger son In time of dearth ; a son , whose worthy deeds Raise him to be the second in that realm Of Pharaoh : There he dies , and leaves his race Growing into a nation , and now grown Suspected to a sequent king , who seeks To stop their overgrowth , as inmate guests Or violence , he of their wicked ways Shall them admonish ; and before them set The paths of righteousness , how much more safe And full of peace ; denouncing wrath to come On their impenitence ; and shall return Of them derided , but of God observed The one just man alive ; by his command Shall build a wonderous ark , as thou beheldst , To save himself , and houshold , from amidst A world devote to universal wrack .
Canaan he now attains ; I see his tents Pitched about Sechem , and the neighbouring plain Of Moreh ; there by promise he receives Gift to his progeny of all that land , From Hameth northward to the Desart south ; ( Things by their names I call , though yet unnamed ;) From Hermon east to the great western Sea ; Mount Hermon , yonder sea ; each place behold In prospect , as I point them ; on the shore Mount Carmel ; here , the double - founted stream , Jordan , true limit eastward ; but his sons Shall dwell to Senir , that long ridge of hills .
This patriarch blest , Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call , A son , and of his son a grand - child , leaves ; Like him in faith , in wisdom , and renown : The grandchild , with twelve sons increased , departs From Canaan to a land hereafter called Egypt , divided by the river Nile See where it flows , disgorging at seven mouths Into the sea .
Thus with ten wounds The river - dragon tamed at length submits To let his sojourners depart , and oft Humbles his stubborn heart ; but still , as ice More hardened after thaw ; till , in his rage Pursuing whom he late dismissed , the sea Swallows him with his host ; but them lets pass , As on dry land , between two crystal walls ; Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand Divided , till his rescued gain their shore : Such wondrous power God to his saint will lend , Though present in his Angel ; who shall go Before them in a cloud , and pillar of fire ; By day a cloud , by night a pillar of fire ; To guide them in their journey , and remove Behind them , while the obdurate king pursues : All night he will pursue ; but his approach Darkness defends between till morning watch ; Then through the fiery pillar , and the cloud , God looking forth will trouble all his host , And craze their chariot - wheels : when by command Moses once more his potent rod extends Over the sea ; the sea his rod obeys ; On their embattled ranks the waves return , And overwhelm their war : The race elect Safe toward Canaan from the shore advance Through the wild Desart , not the readiest way ; Lest , entering on the Canaanite alarmed , War terrify them inexpert , and fear Return them back to Egypt , choosing rather Inglorious life with servitude ; for life To noble and ignoble is more sweet Untrained in arms , where rashness leads not on .
so call the third From Abraham , son of Isaac ; and from him His whole descent , who thus shall Canaan win .
This yet I apprehend not , why to those Among whom God will deign to dwell on earth So many and so various laws are given ; So many laws argue so many sins Among them ; how can God with such reside ?
Doubt not but that sin Will reign among them , as of thee begot ; And therefore was law given them , to evince Their natural pravity , by stirring up Sin against law to fight : that when they see Law can discover sin , but not remove , Save by those shadowy expiations weak , The blood of bulls and goats , they may conclude Some blood more precious must be paid for Man ; Just for unjust ; that , in such righteousness To them by faith imputed , they may find Justification towards God , and peace Of conscience ; which the law by ceremonies Cannot appease ; nor Man the mortal part Perform ; and , not performing , cannot live .
And therefore shall not Moses , though of God Highly beloved , being but the minister Of law , his people into Canaan lead ; But Joshua , whom the Gentiles Jesus call , His name and office bearing , who shall quell The adversary - Serpent , and bring back Through the world ' s wilderness long - wandered Man Safe to eternal Paradise of rest .
Mean while they , in their earthly Canaan placed , Long time shall dwell and prosper , but when sins National interrupt their publick peace , Provoking God to raise them enemies ; From whom as oft he saves them penitent By Judges first , then under Kings ; of whom The second , both for piety renowned And puissant deeds , a promise shall receive Irrevocable , that his regal throne For ever shall endure ; the like shall sing All Prophecy , that of the royal stock Of David ( so I name this king ) shall rise A Son , the Woman ' s seed to thee foretold , Foretold to Abraham , as in whom shall trust All nations ; and to kings foretold , of kings The last ; for of his reign shall be no end .
Dream not of their fight , As of a duel , or the local wounds Of head or heel : Not therefore joins the Son Manhood to Godhead , with more strength to foil Thy enemy ; nor so is overcome Satan , whose fall from Heaven , a deadlier bruise , Disabled , not to give thee thy death ' s wound : Which he , who comes thy Saviour , shall recure , Not by destroying Satan , but his works In thee , and in thy seed : Nor can this be , But by fulfilling that which thou didst want , Obedience to the law of God , imposed On penalty of death , and suffering death ; The penalty to thy transgression due , And due to theirs which out of thine will grow : So only can high Justice rest appaid .
Be sure they will , said the Angel ; but from Heaven He to his own a Comforter will send , The promise of the Father , who shall dwell His Spirit within them ; and the law of faith , Working through love , upon their hearts shall write , To guide them in all truth ; and also arm With spiritual armour , able to resist Satan ' s assaults , and quench his fiery darts ; What man can do against them , not afraid , Though to the death ; against such cruelties With inward consolations recompensed , And oft supported so as shall amaze Their proudest persecutors : For the Spirit , Poured first on his Apostles , whom he sends To evangelize the nations , then on all Baptized , shall them with wonderous gifts endue To speak all tongues , and do all miracles , As did their Lord before them .
for , on earth , Who against faith and conscience can be heard Infallible ?
Beyond is all abyss , Eternity , whose end no eye can reach .
Greatly - instructed I shall hence depart ; Greatly in peace of thought ; and have my fill Of knowledge , what this vessel can contain ; Beyond which was my folly to aspire .
Nay I beseech you Sir , be not out with me : yet if you be out Sir , I can mend you

I did send to you For certaine summes of Gold , which you deny ' d me , For I can raise no money by vile meanes : By Heauen , I had rather Coine my Heart , And drop my blood for Drachmaes , then to wring From the hard hands of Peazants , their vile trash By any indirection .
Free from the Bondage you are in Messala , The Conquerors can but make a fire of him : For Brutus onely ouercame himselfe , And no man else hath Honor by his death
Good now sit downe , & tell me he that knowes Why this same strict and most obseruant Watch , So nightly toyles the subiect of the Land , And why such dayly Cast of Brazon Cannon And Forraigne Mart for Implements of warre : Why such impresse of Ship - wrights , whose sore Taske Do ' s not diuide the Sunday from the weeke , What might be toward , that this sweaty hast Doth make the Night ioynt - Labourer with the day : Who is ' t that can informe me ?

The chariest Maid is Prodigall enough , If she vnmaske her beauty to the Moone : Vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes , The Canker Galls , the Infants of the Spring Too oft before the buttons be disclos ' d , And in the Morne and liquid dew of Youth , Contagious blastments are most imminent .
Giue euery man thine eare ; but few thy voyce : Take each mans censure ; but reserue thy iudgement : Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy ; But not exprest in fancie ; rich , not gawdie : For the Apparell oft proclaimes the man .

And for that purpose Ile annoint my Sword : I bought an Vnction of a Mountebanke So mortall , I but dipt a knife in it , Where it drawes blood , no Cataplasme so rare , Collected from all Simples that haue Vertue Vnder the Moone , can saue the thing from death , That is but scratcht withall : Ile touch my point , With this contagion , that if I gall him slightly , It may be death

5 Dead poets , philosophs , priests , Martyrs , artists , inventors , governments long since , Language - shapers on other shores , Nations once powerful , now reduced , withdrawn , or desolate , I dare not proceed till I respectfully credit what you have left wafted hither , I have perused it , own it is admirable , ( moving awhile among it ,) Think nothing can ever be greater , nothing can ever deserve more than it deserves , Regarding it all intently a long while , then dismissing it , I stand in my place with my own day here .
do you concentrate in me , for I am determin ' d to tell you with courageous clear voice to prove you illustrious , And I will show that there is no imperfection in the present , and can be none in the future , And I will show that whatever happens to anybody it may be turn ' d to beautiful results , And I will show that nothing can happen more beautiful than death , And I will thread a thread through my poems that time and events are compact , And that all the things of the universe are perfect miracles , each as profound as any .
All hold spiritual joys and afterwards loosen them ; How can the real body ever die and be buried ?
No dainty dolce affettuoso I , Bearded , sun - burnt , gray - neck ' d , forbidding , I have arrived , To be wrestled with as I pass for the solid prizes of the universe , For such I afford whoever can persevere to win them .
The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections , They scorn the best I can do to relate them .
I am enamour ' d of growing out - doors , Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods , Of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and mauls , and the drivers of horses , I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out .
One world is aware and by far the largest to me , and that is myself , And whether I come to my own to - day or in ten thousand or ten million years , I can cheerfully take it now , or with equal cheerfulness I can wait .
I resign myself to you also -- I guess what you mean , I behold from the beach your crooked fingers , I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me , We must have a turn together , I undress , hurry me out of sight of the land , Cushion me soft , rock me in billowy drowse , Dash me with amorous wet , I can repay you .
What behaved well in the past or behaves well to - day is not such wonder , The wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man or an infidel .
I merely stir , press , feel with my fingers , and am happy , To touch my person to some one else ' s is about as much as I can stand .
I help myself to material and immaterial , No guard can shut me off , no law prevent me .
Only three guns are in use , One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy ' s main - mast , Two well serv ' d with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his decks .
36 Stretch ' d and still lies the midnight , Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness , Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking , preparations to pass to the one we have conquer ' d , The captain on the quarter - deck coldly giving his orders through a countenance white as a sheet , Near by the corpse of the child that serv ' d in the cabin , The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curl ' d whiskers , The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below , The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty , Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves , dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars , Cut of cordage , dangle of rigging , slight shock of the soothe of waves , Black and impassive guns , litter of powder - parcels , strong scent , A few large stars overhead , silent and mournful shining , Delicate sniffs of sea - breeze , smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore , death - messages given in charge to survivors , The hiss of the surgeon ' s knife , the gnawing teeth of his saw , Wheeze , cluck , swash of falling blood , short wild scream , and long , dull , tapering groan , These so , these irretrievable .
I do not ask who you are , that is not important to me , You can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold you .
Each who passes is consider ' d , each who stops is consider ' d , not single one can it fall .
I open my scuttle at night and see the far - sprinkled systems , And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the rim of the farther systems .
There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage , If I , you , and the worlds , and all beneath or upon their surfaces , were this moment reduced back to a pallid float , it would not avail the long run , We should surely bring up again where we now stand , And surely go as much farther , and then farther and farther .
Not I , not any one else can travel that road for you , You must travel it for yourself .
I teach straying from me , yet who can stray from me ?
No shutter ' d room or school can commune with me , But roughs and little children better than they .
And I say to mankind , Be not curious about God , For I who am curious about each am not curious about God , ( No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and about death .)
I hear and behold God in every object , yet understand God not in the least , Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself .
I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven , O suns -- O grass of graves -- O perpetual transfers and promotions , If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing ?
Spontaneous me , Nature , The loving day , the mounting sun , the friend I am happy with , The arm of my friend hanging idly over my shoulder , The hillside whiten ' d with blossoms of the mountain ash , The same late in autumn , the hues of red , yellow , drab , purple , and light and dark green , The rich coverlet of the grass , animals and birds , the private untrimm ' d bank , the primitive apples , the pebble - stones , Beautiful dripping fragments , the negligent list of one after another as I happen to call them to me or think of them , The real poems , ( what we call poems being merely pictures ,) The poems of the privacy of the night , and of men like me , This poem drooping shy and unseen that I always carry , and that all men carry , ( Know once for all , avow ' d on purpose , wherever are men like me , are our lusty lurking masculine poems ,) Love - thoughts , love - juice , love - odor , love - yielding , love - climbers , and the climbing sap , Arms and hands of love , lips of love , phallic thumb of love , breasts of love , bellies press ' d and glued together with love , Earth of chaste love , life that is only life after love , The body of my love , the body of the woman I love , the body of the man , the body of the earth , Soft forenoon airs that blow from the south - west , The hairy wild - bee that murmurs and hankers up and down , that gripes the full - grown lady - flower , curves upon her with amorous firm legs , takes his will of her , and holds himself tremulous and tight till he is satisfied ; The wet of woods through the early hours , Two sleepers at night lying close together as they sleep , one with an arm slanting down across and below the waist of the other , The smell of apples , aromas from crush ' d sage - plant , mint , birch - bark , The boy ' s longings , the glow and pressure as he confides to me what he was dreaming , The dead leaf whirling its spiral whirl and falling still and content to the ground , The no - form ' d stings that sights , people , objects , sting me with , The hubb ' d sting of myself , stinging me as much as it ever can any one , The sensitive , orbic , underlapp ' d brothers , that only privileged feelers may be intimate where they are , The curious roamer the hand roaming all over the body , the bashful withdrawing of flesh where the fingers soothingly pause and edge themselves , The limpid liquid within the young man , The vex ' d corrosion so pensive and so painful , The torment , the irritable tide that will not be at rest , The like of the same I feel , the like of the same in others , The young man that flushes and flushes , and the young woman that flushes and flushes , The young man that wakes deep at night , the hot hand seeking to repress what would master him , The mystic amorous night , the strange half - welcome pangs , visions , sweats , The pulse pounding through palms and trembling encircling fingers , the young man all color ' d , red , ashamed , angry ; The souse upon me of my lover the sea , as I lie willing and naked , The merriment of the twin babes that crawl over the grass in the sun , the mother never turning her vigilant eyes from them , The walnut - trunk , the walnut - husks , and the ripening or ripen ' d long - round walnuts , The continence of vegetables , birds , animals , The consequent meanness of me should I skulk or find myself indecent , while birds and animals never once skulk or find themselves indecent , The great chastity of paternity , to match the great chastity of maternity , The oath of procreation I have sworn , my Adamic and fresh daughters , The greed that eats me day and night with hungry gnaw , till I saturate what shall produce boys to fill my place when I am through , The wholesome relief , repose , content , And this bunch pluck ' d at random from myself , It has done its work -- I toss it carelessly to fall where it may .
Why can you not continue ?
In paths untrodden , In the growth by margins of pond - waters , Escaped from the lite that exhibits itself , From all the standards hitherto publish ' d , from the pleasures , profits , conformities , Which too long I was offering to feed my soul , Clear to me now standards not yet publish ' d , clear to me that my soul , That the soul of the man I speak for rejoices in comrades , Here by myself away from the clank of the world , Tallying and talk ' d to here by tongues aromatic , No longer abash ' d , ( for in this secluded spot I can respond as I would not dare elsewhere ,) Strong upon me the life that does not exhibit itself , yet contains all the rest , Resolv ' d to sing no songs to - day but those of manly attachment , Projecting them along that substantial life , Bequeathing hence types of athletic love , Afternoon this delicious Ninth - month in my forty - first year , I proceed for all who are or have been young men , To tell the secret my nights and days , To celebrate the need of comrades .
I permit you to tell in your own way of the heart that is under you , O I do not know what you mean there underneath yourselves , you are not happiness , You are often more bitter than I can bear , you burn and sting me , Yet you are beautiful to me you faint tinged roots , you make me think of death , Death is beautiful from you , ( what indeed is finally beautiful except death and love ?)
This moment yearning and thoughtful sitting alone , It seems to me there are other men in other lands yearning and thoughtful , It seems to me I can look over and behold them in Germany , Italy , France , Spain , Or far , far away , in China , or in Russia or talking other dialects , And it seems to me if I could know those men I should become attached to them as I do to men in my own lands , O I know we should be brethren and lovers , I know I should be happy with them .
more resistless than I can tell , the thought of you !
Here the profound lesson of reception , nor preference nor denial , The black with his woolly head , the felon , the diseas ' d , the illiterate person , are not denied ; The birth , the hasting after the physician , the beggar ' s tramp , the drunkard ' s stagger , the laughing party of mechanics , The escaped youth , the rich person ' s carriage , the fop , the eloping couple , The early market - man , the hearse , the moving of furniture into the town , the return back from the town , They pass , I also pass , any thing passes , none can be interdicted , None but are accepted , none but shall be dear to me .
O public road , I say back I am not afraid to leave you , yet I love you , You express me better than I can express myself , You shall be more to me than my poem .
All seems beautiful to me , can repeat over to men and women You have done such good to me I would do the same to you , I will recruit for myself and you as I go , I will scatter myself among men and women as I go , I will toss a new gladness and roughness among them , Whoever denies me it shall not trouble me , Whoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless me .
The earth never tires , The earth is rude , silent , incomprehensible at first , Nature is rude and incomprehensible at first , Be not discouraged , keep on , there are divine things well envelop ' d , I swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words can tell .
8 Ah , what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than mast - hemm ' d Manhattan ?
What gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand , and with voices I love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as approach ?
He is the Answerer , What can be answer ' d he answers , and what cannot be answer ' d he shows how it cannot be answer ' d .
all so dear to me -- what you are , ( whatever it is ,) I putting it at random in these songs , become a part of that , whatever it is , Southward there , I screaming , with wings slow flapping , with the myriads of gulls wintering along the coasts of Florida , Otherways there atwixt the banks of the Arkansaw , the Rio Grande , the Nueces , the Brazos , the Tombigbee , the Red River , the Saskatchawan or the Osage , I with the spring waters laughing and skipping and running , Northward , on the sands , on some shallow bay of Paumanok , I with parties of snowy herons wading in the wet to seek worms and aquatic plants , Retreating , triumphantly twittering , the king - bird , from piercing the crow with its bill , for amusement -- and I triumphantly twittering , The migrating flock of wild geese alighting in autumn to refresh themselves , the body of the flock feed , the sentinels outside move around with erect heads watching , and are from time to time reliev ' d by other sentinels -- and I feeding and taking turns with the rest , In Kanadian forests the moose , large as an ox , corner ' d by hunters , rising desperately on his hind - feet , and plunging with his fore - feet , the hoofs as sharp as knives -- and I , plunging at the hunters , corner ' d and desperate , In the Mannahatta , streets , piers , shipping , store - houses , and the countless workmen working in the shops , And I too of the Mannahatta , singing thereof -- and no less in myself than the whole of the Mannahatta in itself , Singing the song of These , my ever - united lands -- my body no more inevitably united , part to part , and made out of a thousand diverse contributions one identity , any more than my lands are inevitably united and made ONE IDENTITY ; Nativities , climates , the grass of the great pastoral Plains , Cities , labors , death , animals , products , war , good and evil -- these me , These affording , in all their particulars , the old feuillage to me and to America , how can I do less than pass the clew of the union of them , to afford the like to you ?
how can I but offer you divine leaves , that you also be eligible as I am ?
How can I but as here chanting , invite you for yourself to collect bouquets of the incomparable feuillage of these States ?
To be entirely alone with them , to find how much one can stand !
what can it do now ?
can I believe then , Those ancient temples , sculptures classic , could none of them retain her ?
Yes , if you will allow me to say so , I , my friends , if you do not , can plainly see her , The same undying soul of earth ' s , activity ' s , beauty ' s , heroism ' s expression , Out from her evolutions hither come , ended the strata of her former themes , Hidden and cover ' d by to - day ' s , foundation of to - day ' s , Ended , deceas ' d through time , her voice by Castaly ' s fountain , Silent the broken - lipp ' d Sphynx in Egypt , silent all those century - baffling tombs , Ended for aye the epics of Asia ' s , Europe ' s helmeted warriors , ended the primitive call of the muses , Calliope ' s call forever closed , Clio , Melpomene , Thalia dead , Ended the stately rhythmus of Una and Oriana , ended the quest of the holy Graal , Jerusalem a handful of ashes blown by the wind , extinct , The Crusaders ' streams of shadowy midnight troops sped with the sunrise , Amadis , Tancred , utterly gone , Charlemagne , Roland , Oliver gone , Palmerin , ogre , departed , vanish ' d the turrets that Usk from its waters reflected , Arthur vanish ' d with all his knights , Merlin and Lancelot and Galahad , all gone , dissolv ' d utterly like an exhalation ; Pass ' d !
Can each see signs of the best by a look in the looking - glass ?
When the script preaches instead of the preacher , When the pulpit descends and goes instead of the carver that carved the supporting desk , When I can touch the body of books by night or by day , and when they touch my body back again , When a university course convinces like a slumbering woman and child convince , When the minted gold in the vault smiles like the night - watchman ' s daughter , When warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite and are my friendly companions , I intend to reach them my hand , and make as much of them as I do of men and women like you .
Each man to himself and each woman to herself , is the word of the past and present , and the true word of immortality ; No one can acquire for another -- not one , Not one can grow for another -- not one .
I swear there is no greatness or power that does not emulate those of the earth , There can be no theory of any account unless it corroborate the theory of the earth , No politics , song , religion , behavior , or what not , is of account , unless it compare with the amplitude of the earth , Unless it face the exactness , vitality , impartiality , rectitude of the earth .
Here too the blaze , the grape - shot and the axe , in reserve , to fetch them out in case of need , Here too , though long represt , can never be destroy ' d , Here too could rise at last murdering and ecstatic , Here too demanding full arrears of vengeance .
See my cantabile !
I perceive I have not really understood any thing , not a single object , and that no man ever can , Nature here in sight of the sea taking advantage of me to dart upon me and sting me , Because I have dared to open my mouth to sing at all .
1 To - day a rude brief recitative , Of ships sailing the seas , each with its special flag or ship - signal , Of unnamed heroes in the ships -- of waves spreading and spreading far as the eye can reach , Of dashing spray , and the winds piping and blowing , And out of these a chant for the sailors of all nations , Fitful , like a surge .
Of sea - captains young or old , and the mates , and of all intrepid sailors , Of the few , very choice , taciturn , whom fate can never surprise nor death dismay .
Worse and worse -- can ' t you stand it ?
Not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose , But it stalks invisibly over the earth , whispering , counseling , cautioning .
Outside fair costume , within ashes and filth , No more a flashing eye , no more a sonorous voice or springy step , Now some slave ' s eye , voice , hands , step , A drunkard ' s breath , unwholesome eater ' s face , venerealee ' s flesh , Lungs rotting away piecemeal , stomach sour and cankerous , Joints rheumatic , bowels clogged with abomination , Blood circulating dark and poisonous streams , Words babble , hearing and touch callous , No brain , no heart left , no magnetism of sex ; Such from one look in this looking - glass ere you go hence , Such a result so soon -- and from such a beginning !
Give me your hand old Revolutionary , The hill - top is nigh , but a few steps , ( make room gentlemen ,) Up the path you have follow ' d me well , spite of your hundred and extra years , You can walk old man , though your eyes are almost done , Your faculties serve you , and presently I must have them serve me .
Fast as she can she hurries , something ominous , her steps trembling , She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap .
1 Give me the splendid silent sun with all his beams full - dazzling , Give me autumnal fruit ripe and red from the orchard , Give me a field where the unmow ' d grass grows , Give me an arbor , give me the trellis ' d grape , Give me fresh corn and wheat , give me serene - moving animals teaching content , Give me nights perfectly quiet as on high plateaus west of the Mississippi , and I looking up at the stars , Give me odorous at sunrise a garden of beautiful flowers where I can walk undisturb ' d , Give me for marriage a sweet - breath ' d woman of whom I should never tire , Give me a perfect child , give me away aside from the noise of the world a rural domestic life , Give me to warble spontaneous songs recluse by myself , for my own ears only , Give me solitude , give me Nature , give me again O Nature your primal sanities !
therefore leave my works , And go lull yourself with what you can understand , and with piano - tunes , For I lull nobody , and you will never understand me .
2 A Nation announcing itself , I myself make the only growth by which I can be appreciated , I reject none , accept all , then reproduce all in my own forms .
There can be any number of supremes -- one does not countervail another any more than one eyesight countervails another , or one life countervails another .
Of them standing among them , one lifts to the light a west - bred face , To him the hereditary countenance bequeath ' d both mother ' s and father ' s , His first parts substances , earth , water , animals , trees , Built of the common stock , having room for far and near , Used to dispense with other lands , incarnating this land , Attracting it body and soul to himself , hanging on its neck with incomparable love , Plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits , Making its cities , beginnings , events , diversities , wars , vocal in him , Making its rivers , lakes , bays , embouchure in him , Mississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes , Columbia , Niagara , Hudson , spending themselves lovingly in him , If the Atlantic coast stretch or the Pacific coast stretch , he stretching with them North or South , Spanning between them East and West , and touching whatever is between them , Growths growing from him to offset the growths of pine , cedar , hemlock , live - oak , locust , chestnut , hickory , cottonwood , orange , magnolia , Tangles as tangled in him as any canebrake or swamp , He likening sides and peaks of mountains , forests coated with northern transparent ice , Off him pasturage sweet and natural as savanna , upland , prairie , Through him flights , whirls , screams , answering those of the fish - hawk , mocking - bird , night - heron , and eagle , His spirit surrounding his country ' s spirit , unclosed to good and evil , Surrounding the essences of real things , old times and present times , Surrounding just found shores , islands , tribes of red aborigines , Weather - beaten vessels , landings , settlements , embryo stature and muscle , The haughty defiance of the Year One , war , peace , the formation of the Constitution , The separate States , the simple elastic scheme , the immigrants , The Union always swarming with blatherers and always sure and impregnable , The unsurvey ' d interior , log - houses , clearings , wild animals , hunters , trappers , Surrounding the multiform agriculture , mines , temperature , the gestation of new States , Congress convening every Twelfth - month , the members duly coming up from the uttermost parts , Surrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers , especially the young men , Responding their manners , speech , dress , friendships , the gait they have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors , The freshness and candor of their physiognomy , the copiousness and decision of their phrenology , The picturesque looseness of their carriage , their fierceness when wrong ' d , The fluency of their speech , their delight in music , their curiosity , good temper and open - handedness , the whole composite make , The prevailing ardor and enterprise , the large amativeness , The perfect equality of the female with the male , the fluid movement of the population , The superior marine , free commerce , fisheries , whaling , gold - digging , Wharf - hemm ' d cities , railroad and steamboat lines intersecting all points , Factories , mercantile life , labor - saving machinery , the Northeast , Northwest , Southwest , Manhattan firemen , the Yankee swap , southern plantation life , Slavery -- the murderous , treacherous conspiracy to raise it upon the ruins of all the rest , On and on to the grapple with it -- Assassin !
9 I listened to the Phantom by Ontario ' s shore , I heard the voice arising demanding bards , By them all native and grand , by them alone can these States be fused into the compact organism of a Nation .
10 Of these States the poet is the equable man , Not in him but off from him things are grotesque , eccentric , fail of their full returns , Nothing out of its place is good , nothing in its place is bad , He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion , neither more nor less , He is the arbiter of the diverse , he is the key , He is the equalizer of his age and land , He supplies what wants supplying , he checks what wants checking , In peace out of him speaks the spirit of peace , large , rich , thrifty , building populous towns , encouraging agriculture , arts , commerce , lighting the study of man , the soul , health , immortality , government , In war he is the best backer of the war , he fetches artillery as good as the engineer ' s , he can make every word he speaks draw blood , The years straying toward infidelity he withholds by his steady faith , He is no arguer , he is judgment , ( Nature accepts him absolutely ,) He judges not as the judge judges but as the sun failing round helpless thing , As he sees the farthest he has the most faith , His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things , In the dispute on God and eternity he is silent , He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement , He sees eternity in men and women , he does not see men and women as dreams or dots .
Can you hold your hand against all seductions , follies , whirls , fierce contentions ?

13 Rhymes and rhymers pass away , poems distill ' d from poems pass away , The swarms of reflectors and the polite pass , and leave ashes , Admirers , importers , obedient persons , make but the soil of literature , America justifies itself , give it time , no disguise can deceive it or conceal from it , it is impassive enough , Only toward the likes of itself will it advance to meet them , If its poets appear it will in due time advance to meet them , there is no fear of mistake , ( The proof of a poet shall be sternly deferr ' d till his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorb ' d it .)
I am for those that have never been master ' d , For men and women whose tempers have never been master ' d , For those whom laws , theories , conventions , can never master .

The soul is of itself , All verges to it , all has reference to what ensues , All that a person does , says , thinks , is of consequence , Not a move can a man or woman make , that affects him or her in a day , month , any part of the direct lifetime , or the hour of death , But the same affects him or her onward afterward through the indirect lifetime .
Inside these breast - bones I lie smutch ' d and choked , Beneath this face that appears so impassive hell ' s tides continually run , Lusts and wickedness are acceptable to me , I walk with delinquents with passionate love , I feel I am of them -- I belong to those convicts and prostitutes myself , And henceforth I will not deny them -- for how can I deny myself ?
Unfolded out of the folds of the woman man comes unfolded , and is always to come unfolded , Unfolded only out of the superbest woman of the earth is to come the superbest man of the earth , Unfolded out of the friendliest woman is to come the friendliest man , Unfolded only out of the perfect body of a woman can a man be form ' d of perfect body , Unfolded only out of the inimitable poems of woman can come the poems of man , ( only thence have my poems come ;) Unfolded out of the strong and arrogant woman I love , only thence can appear the strong and arrogant man I love , Unfolded by brawny embraces from the well - muscled woman love , only thence come the brawny embraces of the man , Unfolded out of the folds of the woman ' s brain come all the folds of the man ' s brain , duly obedient , Unfolded out of the justice of the woman all justice is unfolded , Unfolded out of the sympathy of the woman is all sympathy ; A man is a great thing upon the earth and through eternity , but every of the greatness of man is unfolded out of woman ; First the man is shaped in the woman , he can then be shaped in himself .
And that I can think such thoughts as these is just as wonderful , And that I can remind you , and you think them and know them to be true , is just as wonderful .
how uneasy they are when he moves away from them ; Now I marvel what it can be he appears to them , ( books , politics , poems , depart -- all else departs ,) I confess I envy only his fascination -- my silent , illiterate friend , Whom a hundred oxen love there in his life on farms , In the northern county far , in the placid pastoral region .
A festival song , The duet of the bridegroom and the bride , a marriage - march , With lips of love , and hearts of lovers fill ' d to the brim with love , The red - flush ' d cheeks and perfumes , the cortege swarming full of friendly faces young and old , To flutes ' clear notes and sounding harps ' cantabile .
8 O we can wait no longer , We too take ship O soul , Joyous we too launch out on trackless seas , Fearless for unknown shores on waves of ecstasy to sail , Amid the wafting winds , ( thou pressing me to thee , I thee to me , O soul ,) Caroling free , singing our song of God , Chanting our chant of pleasant exploration .
Well do they do their jobs those journeymen divine , Only from me can they hide nothing , and would not if they could , I reckon I am their boss and they make me a pet besides , And surround me and lead me and run ahead when I walk , To lift their cunning covers to signify me with stretch ' d arms , and resume the way ; Onward we move , a gay gang of blackguards !
I cannot aid with my wringing fingers , I can but rush to the surf and let it drench me and freeze upon me .
The law of the past cannot be eluded , The law of the present and future cannot be eluded , The law of the living cannot be eluded , it is eternal , The law of promotion and transformation cannot be eluded , The law of heroes and good - doers cannot be eluded , The law of drunkards , informers , mean persons , not one iota thereof can be eluded .
I do not doubt that wrecks at sea , no matter what the horrors of them , no matter whose wife , child , husband , father , lover , has gone down , are provided for , to the minutest points , I do not doubt that whatever can possibly happen anywhere at any time , is provided for in the inherences of things , I do not think Life provides for all and for Time and Space , but I believe Heavenly Death provides for all .
5 Beautiful world of new superber birth that rises to my eyes , Like a limitless golden cloud filling the westernr sky , Emblem of general maternity lifted above all , Sacred shape of the bearer of daughters and sons , Out of thy teeming womb thy giant babes in ceaseless procession issuing , Acceding from such gestation , taking and giving continual strength and life , World of the real -- world of the twain in one , World of the soul , born by the world of the real alone , led to identity , body , by it alone , Yet in beginning only , incalculable masses of composite precious materials , By history ' s cycles forwarded , by every nation , language , hither sent , Ready , collected here , a freer , vast , electric world , to be constructed here , ( The true New World , the world of orbic science , morals , literatures to come ,) Thou wonder world yet undefined , unform ' d , neither do I define thee , How can I pierce the impenetrable blank of the future ?
The Present holds thee not -- for such vast growth as thine , For such unparallel ' d flight as thine , such brood as thine , The FUTURE only holds thee and can hold thee .
This is a full - grown lily ' s face , She speaks to the limber - hipp ' d man near the garden pickets , Come here she blushingly cries , Come nigh to me limber - hipp ' d man , Stand at my side till I lean as high as I can upon you , Fill me with albescent honey , bend down to me , Rub to me with your chafing beard , rub to my breast and shoulders .
O tender and fierce pangs , I can stand them not , I will depart ; O to be a Virginian where I grew up !
O me , man of slack faith so long , Standing aloof , denying portions so long , Only aware to - day of compact all - diffused truth , Discovering to - day there is no lie or form of lie , and can be none , but grows as inevitably upon itself as the truth does upon itself , Or as any law of the earth or any natural production of the earth does .
I announce natural persons to arise , I announce justice triumphant , I announce uncompromising liberty and equality , I announce the justification of candor and the justification of pride .
The perfect singing voice -- deepest of all to me the lesson -- trial and test of all :) How through those strains distill ' d -- how the rapt ears , the soul of me , absorbing Fernando ' s heart , Manrico ' s passionate call , Ernani ' s , sweet Gennaro ' s , I fold thenceforth , or seek to fold , within my chants transmuting , Freedom ' s and Love ' s and Faith ' s unloos ' d cantabile , ( As perfume ' s , color ' s , sunlight ' s correlation :) From these , for these , with these , a hurried line , dead tenor , A wafted autumn leaf , dropt in the closing grave , the shovel ' d earth , To memory of thee .
Nothing is ever really lost , or can be lost , No birth , identity , form -- no object of the world .

Motorists like myself who can remember the old `` tourists accommodated '' signs on farm houses and village homes before World War 2 , can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business .
But we can't tell it all now and then have no new excitement later '' .

`` As we look to the $800 billion economy that is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40% in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal , management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed '' , Peterson said .

Naturally , enterprises of the size of General Electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time .
( Pp. 228-229 ) in any event , it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known , held together by some of the most fantastic ideas , all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government '' .
However , one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust laws are effective and rational .

The British coal industry is unprofitable , has large coal stocks it can't sell .
Confronted with this situation , most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have , or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds .
Local libraries find , too , that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system , and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library .
Librarians , a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication , can begin to see results today .
Education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives , for it is only through knowledge that we , as a nation , can cope with the dangers that threaten our society .
Only public understanding and support can provide that service .
Certainly all can applaud passage of an auto title law , the school bills , the increase in teacher pensions , the ban on drag racing , acceptance by the state of responsibility for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate as outside city limits , repeal of the college age limit law and the road maintenance bond issue .
It recognizes the fact that what helps one county helps its neighbors and that by banding together in an area-wide effort better results can be accomplished than through the go-it-alone approach .
That such expansion can be obtained without a raise in taxes is due to growth of the tax digest and sound fiscal planning on the part of the board of commissioners , headed by Chairman Charles O. Emmerich who is demonstrating that the public trust he was given was well placed , and other county officials .
High-speed buses on the George Washington Memorial Parkway , operating between downtown Washington and Cabin John , Glen Echo and Brookmont , would constitute an alluring sample of what the new National Capital Transportation Agency can do for this city .
There remains , of course , the question of what the West can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts .
But if anything can bring home to Mr. Khrushchev the idea that he will not really get much enjoyment from watching this Braddock-against-the-Indians contest , it will probably be the fact that SEATO forces are ready to attempt it -- plus the fact that Moscow has something to lose from closing off disarmament and other bigger negotiations with Washington .
The probable answer is that it will do so just as long as Russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young African nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting ruin on Central Africa .
Meanwhile , in Moscow , Khrushchev was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of TNT , to knock sense into the heads of those backward oafs who can't see the justice of surrendering West Berlin to communism .
While he was at it , the philosopher of the Kremlin contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in the west who can't appreciate coexistence thru suicide .
The only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren't playing the marimba with our shoes in the United Nations , but perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this feeble effort .
Perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing American diplomatic papers and planes , but the Kennedy administration can always file a demurrer to the effect that , but for its own incompetence in protecting American interests , these things would not happen .
The same can be said about the half-hearted Cuban invasion mounted by the administration last April , which , we trust , is not symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious Khrushchev .
The request for lower rates originated with the Southern railway , which has spent a good deal of time and money developing a 100-ton hopper car with which it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional , smaller car .

Whatever land you can see here , from the North tip end of Elliott Key looking southward , belongs to someone -- people who have title to the land .
And what you can't see , the land underneath the water , belongs to someone , too .
The only real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the above-water land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment .

Old , tired , trembling the woman came to the cannery .
She was ready to kill the beef , dress it out , and with vegetables from her garden was going to can soup , broth , hash , and stew against the winter .
And now , the woman , tired and trembling , came here to the DeKalb County cannery .
`` Is it so the cannery is going to close '' ? ?
Threat of closing the cannery is a recent one .
A three-man committee has recommended to Commission Chairman Charles O. Emmerich that the DeKalb County cannery be closed .
Reason : the cannery loses $3,000 yearly .
But DeKalb citizens , those who use the facilities of the cannery , say the cannery is not supposed to make any money .
`` The cannery '' , said Mrs. Lewellyn Lundeen , an active booster of the cannery since its opening during the war and rationing years of 1941 , to handle the `` victory garden '' produce , `` is a service to the taxpayer .
And one of the best services available to the people who try to raise and can meat , to plant , grow vegetables and put them up .
A driver of a dairy truck , who begins work at 1 a.m. finishes before breakfast , then goes out and grows a garden , and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family of five , asked , `` What in the world will we do '' ? ?
Moss , a man who knows how much the cannery helps the county , doesn't believe it will close .
`` Don't ask me if I think the cannery helps '' , he said .
`` Sir , I know the cannery helps '' .

This angle of just where the Orioles can look for improvement this year is an interesting one .
Where can that improvement possibly come from ? ?
You certainly can't expect the infield to do any better than it did last year .
You can't expect it , though .
If they do as well as they did in 1960 there can be no complaint .
Gentile can hardly do better than drive in 98 runs .
So , all in all , the infield can't be expected to supply the added improvement to propel the Birds from second to first .
Where , then , can we look for improvement ? ?

If he can bounce back with one of those 25 home runs years , the club will have to be better off offensively .

The brushes can be cleaned and sterilized by boiling and are detachable so that every member of the family can have his own .
The same can be said of shaving yet the electric razor has proved useful to many men .
What can a mother do then to prevent misbehavior ? ?
She can decrease the number of temptations .
She can remove all knick-knacks within reach .
If he can't play with Mommy's magazines , he should have some old numbers of his own .
Toys he has can be made to act as substitutes for family temptations such as refrigerator and gas stove .

I was surprised at Mayor Miriani's defeat , but perhaps Mayor-elect Cavanagh can accomplish some things that should have been done years ago .
Maybe he can clean out the white elephants in some of the city departments such as welfare , DPW and sanitation .
How can we old-fashioned parents , who still feel that adults are due some respect from children , battle the new type of advertising that appears on TV without denying the children the use of television entirely ? ?
I suppose I am missing some elementary point but I honestly cannot see how two wrongs can make a right ! !
As I see it , if war starts and we survive the initial attack enough to be able to fight back , the nuclear weapons we now have -- at least the bombs -- can inflict all the demage that is necessary .
At Khrushchev's door , therefore , can be placed the primary blame but also at fault are those who permitted themselves to be intimidated .
It is well for us to remember that a wreath on a coffin never can atone for flowers withheld while they still can be enjoyed .

A sweetheart arrangement can come about as often by employers doing the corrupting as by unscrupulous labor leaders demanding tribute .
`` Only a discontinuity can end it '' , Professor Morrison writes .
`` The discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction , or that of diplomatic policy '' .
He feels , therefore , that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the United States is the least risky path our government can take .
Or the city can be a graveyard monument to Western intransigence , if that is what the West wants .

`` If the day should ever come that foreign invaders swarm ashore along the Gulf Coast '' , the account reads , `` they can count on heavy opposition from a group of commando-trained telephone employees -- all girls .
The official military establishment can only threaten to use its nuclear arms ; ;
Besides the lack of an adequate ethical dimension to the Governor's case , one can ask seriously whether our lead over the Russians in quality and quantity of nuclear weapons is so slight as to make the tests absolutely necessary .
Nor can one forget Pope John's unprecedented meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury .
Can any Christian fail to respond to these words ? ?
Certainly it isn't making the President happy , and he has been doing his apologetic best to explain how the budget got into its unbalanced condition , how he intends to economize wherever he can and how he hopes to do better next year .
Their answer was : it can be done , and we will do it .
What evidence is there of an objective kind that in fact your government proposes to do just that , and that it can be done '' ? ?
On these they feel they can rely .
This prime element of the truth may be stated as follows : Under prevailing policy , the U.S. can take the initiative against the Right , but cannot take the initiative against the Left .
There is even some question whether the U.S. can any longer defend itself against an initiative by the Left .

To think that we can merely relinquish our economic autonomy without giving up our political or legal autonomy is wishful thinking .
With this no loyal citizen can quarrel .
This affects us all intimately , and can leave us hopeless in the face of widespread distress .
I know of no other solution than the one N.C. proposes -- to do what we can for each sufferer as he confronts us , hoping that this will spread beyond him to others at some time and some place .

Those would be reserved for the orchestra's great nights when the soloist can surpass himself .
There was in the Brahms none of the mysterious and marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist , orchestra and music to ultimate fusion .
It got the kind of scrambled , coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestras when the man with the baton lacks technique and style .
About that same time John Crosby's TV series on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing space is one of the most sensible things a producer can do .
His bel canto style gave the performance a special distinction .

Whether fan of the Pagnol films or stage show , whether partial to music or not , you can't help but derive joy from this picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart .
Since rococo music tends to be pretty and elegant above all , it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth-century ears that have grown accustomed to the stress and dissonances of composers from Beethoven to Boulez .
On the contrary , Miss Mao and Mr. Fuller chose many of their arrangements from the works of composers such as Mendelssohn , Dvorak , Canteloube , Copland and Britten .
The humor of the situation can be imagined .
Her `` Rockabye Your Baby '' was as good as it can be done , and her really personal songs , like `` The Man That Got Away '' were deeply moving .

In all big cities outside the South , and even in small towns within the South , radio stations can be found beaming some or all of their programs at Negro listeners .
`` Negro-appeal radio is more important to the Negro today , because it provides a direct and powerful mirror in which the Negro can hear and see his ambitions , achievements and desires .

For style and assurance , for a supreme and regal bearing there is still no one who can touch her .
Instead of her old confidence in the simplest , purest , most moving musical expression , Miss Schwarzkopf is letting herself be tempted by the classic sin of artistic pride -- that subtle vanity that sometimes misleads a great artist into thinking that he or she can somehow better the music by bringing to it something extra , some personal dramatic touch imposed from the outside .
But , even if Mr. Sansom labors too hard to extract more refinements of meaning and feeling from his travel experiences than the limits of language allow , he still can charm and astound .
So in these pages one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta of St. Torpetius that still persists in St. Tropez ; ;
Mr. Sansom can be eloquent in a spectacular way which recalls ( to those who recall easily ) the statues of Bernini and the gigantic paintings of Tintoretto .
He can coin a neat phrase : `` a street spattered with an invigoration of people '' ; ;
And , for all his lacquered , almost Byzantine self-consciousness , he can make one recognize the aptness of an unexpected comparison .

There is no framework or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and no part of reality , as we know and apprehend it , with respect to which we can refer this experience .
Instead , the audience can sit back at ease and , from the perspective of an enlightened time which no longer believes in such things , enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take the witches and devils which are under discussion .
For all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night , the demon world is populated with real creatures , and witches actually can be seen flying through the air .
In our disbelief we think that we can no longer even use the word and so are unable to even name the elemental power which is so vividly real in this play .
Yet it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and known .
If the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be `` understanded of the people '' -- and this , it must not be forgotten , is one of the goals of the perennial theological task -- there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation .
This does not mean that mythological language as such can no longer be used in theology and preaching .
Mythological concepts may by all means still be used , but they can be used responsibly only as `` symbols '' or `` ciphers '' , that is , only if they are also constantly interpreted in nonmythological ( or existential ) terms .
On the contrary , even in the heart of `` the Bible belt '' itself , as can be attested by any one who is called to work there , the industrial and technological revolutions have long been under way , together with the corresponding changes in man's picture of himself and his world .
In the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed , the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at hand -- and this usually means one or another of the various forms of `` folk religion '' current in the situation .
But can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation ? ?
Can the church risk assuming that the `` folly '' of men is as dear to God as their `` wisdom '' , or , as is also commonly implied , that `` the foolishness of God '' and `` the foolishness of men '' are simply two ways of talking about the same thing ? ?
Can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious ? ?
But , as Scripture everywhere reminds us , God does have need of his creatures , and the church , a fortiori , can ill afford to do without the talents with which the world , by God's providence , presents it .
And yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume , as we too often do , that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men .
Until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand , we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends .
In arguing in this way , we are obviously taking for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved ; ;
However much we may have to criticize liberal theology's constructive formulations , the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism , not behind it .
But how can one figure symbolize both ? ?
His death is his alone , yet each man can see his own death in the crucifixion of Jesus .
Each man can identify himself with the history and the death of Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ has identified himself with human history and human death , coming as the head of a new humanity .
As man can live only by dying , so it was only by his dying that Christ could bring many to life .
They speak of the work of Christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility , which can mean ( though it does not have to mean ) deliverance from time and history .
One can even argue -- though this is a delicate matter -- that every justification existed for their returning the Public Lecture to the First Church , and so to suppress it , rather than let Parker use it as a sounding board for his propaganda when his turn should come to occupy it .
Fortunately , the honor of the denomination can attest that Cyrus Bartol defended Parker's sincerity , as did also Gannett and Chandler Robbins ; ;
Hence he was in his lifetime , as is the memory of him afterwards , a canker within the liberal sensitivity .
Nevertheless , we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace ; ;
There can be no doubt , the Boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel in enforcing its canons of behavior .
I think it fair to say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons .
Nor can any man save himself by good works or by a commendable `` moral life '' , although such works are the natural fruits and evidences of a saving faith already received and naturally expressing itself through such avenues .
What a joy to realize that we , too , can claim this promise tendered by the Lord during His earthly ministry to a group of men who were very dear to Him .
Such a calm and assuring peace can be yours .
As only a member of the family can share in the innermost joys of the family , likewise one must belong to the family of God in order to receive the benefits that are promised to those who are His own .
not that empty peace the world offers , but a deep , abiding peace which nothing can destroy .
Why not open your heart to the Lord Jesus Christ now , accept Him as your Saviour and let Him fill you with peace that only He can give .
Then , with the hymn writer of old , you can say :
Cape Canaveral's achievements thunder forth from the radio , television , and newspaper .
Only He can satisfy the deepest longings .
You can receive God into your heart and life by a step of personal faith .
Watch people flock to amusement houses , cocktail lounges , and night clubs that advertise continuous entertainment , which means an endless flow of noise and frivolity by paid entertainers who are supposed to perform in those incredible ways which are designed to give men a few hours of dubious relaxation -- watch them and you can tell that many of them are running away from something .
Meanwhile , the enemy will capitalize on our fears , if he can .
The fear of war can make us either too weak to stand and too willing to compromise , or too reckless and too nervous to negotiate for peace as long as there is any chance to negotiate .
Yes indeed , we too can see a warlike host of infidels encamped against us .
If God be for us , who can be against us ? ?
and then , with this God on our side , we can face the whole world without fear .
Thus , while it remains possible that the Babylonians and/or the Pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square of three before the Chinese did , more definite evidence will have to turn up from the Middle East or the Classical World before China can lose her claim to the earliest known magic square by more than a thousand years .
The importance of this 5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the numbers -- quite apart from any numerological considerations , which is to say , any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it .
According to this doctrine , the universe was ruled by Heaven , T'ien -- as a natural force , or in the personification of a Supreme Sky-god -- governing all things by means of a process called the Tao , which can be roughly interpreted as `` the Order of the Universe '' or `` the Universal Way '' .
A program of Lay Visitation Evangelism can end in dismal defeat with half the new members drifting away unless practical plans and strenuous efforts are made to keep them in the active fellowship .
It can mean the difference between participation and inaction , spiritual growth and decay .
The atmosphere for this momentous experience can be created most effectively through the worship experience .
new members can become participating , growing members .
The statement also points to a classic paradox : The more men turn toward God , who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established , the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one another .
Massacres attending the partition of India and the establishment of the State of Israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such divisions can engender .
The only way that I can see is through communication .
Some interfaith tensions are not occasioned by theological differences at all , but by the need of men to have persons they can blame , distrust , denounce , and even hate .
It is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must learn to recognize when it is they , rather than pretexts for them , that are causing the trouble , and do everything possible to nurture the healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such deficiencies .
`` What is the point '' , Charles Adams reports the Pakistanis as asking , `` in demanding an Islamic state and society if no one , not even the doctors of the sacred law themselves , can say clearly and succinctly what the nature of such a state and society is '' ? ?
Comparable trends can be noted elsewhere .
Of course , in prudential calculation , in balancing the good directly intended and done against the evil unintended and indirectly done , no greater precision can be forthcoming than the subject allows .
Yet it seems clear that there can be no good sufficiently great , or evil repelled sufficiently grave , to warrant the destruction of mankind by man's own action .
He does what he can and may and must , without regarding himself as lord of the future or , on the other hand , as covered with guilt by accident or unforeseen consequences or by results he did not `` permit '' in the sense explained .
and by deriving legitimate decision backward from whatever may conceivably or possibly or probably result , whether by anyone's doing or by accident , it finds itself driven to inaction , to non-political action in politics and non-military action in military affairs , and to the not very surprising discovery that there are now no distinctions on which the defense of justice can possibly be based .
But I can only make this choice because I believe that the risk need not increase , but may be deliberately reduced '' ( by precautions against accidents or by limiting war ? ?
Not to repel injury and uphold and improve pax-ordo means not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice that challenges it at the moment , but also to start down the steep slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand .
That is why it is so very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision as to `` permitted '' effects , and not draw back in fright from any conceivable contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities or probabilities unrelated , or not directly morally related , to what we can and may and must do as long as human history endures .
What social , ethical and theological insights can the church and university help him bring to bear upon his situation ? ?
If we look about the world today , we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization : science and religion .
How can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge ? ?
I won't try the experiment , but I think you can see that if we all knew the secret and we could all let ourselves go , there would be quite an explosion .
It is power with which we can literally rebuild the world , provide adequate housing , food , education , abundant living for everyone everywhere .
You can imagine what it would look like going out on the turnpike with the peas banked up against the houses and covering the cars ; ;
Now although an atom is small , we can still in imagination have a look at it .
And to see the meaning of this new picture , imagine that you can put on more powerful glasses and go back inside the atom and have a look at it in the way we view it today .
And as the waves flow back and forth and merge with the waves from the neighboring atoms , you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear music .
Although a complete picture cannot be given , we can indicate some aspects of life into which the Christian faith entered as at least one creative factor .
At times we can say that it was the major factor .
What we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusions is to point out the manner in which Christianity entered into particular aspects of the life of the nation .
But the `` marvelous person '' that is supposed to result from Zen exhibits more Chinese practicality than Indian speculation -- he possesses magical powers , and can use them to order nature and to redeem souls .
`` We hope '' , they said , `` that no family can be found amongst us without a correct version of the Holy Scriptures '' .
You can do likewise though Christ is not bodily present .
You can ignore Him .
You can ignore His Book , the Bible , and His church .
You can laugh at His blood-bought salvation , curse His followers , and laugh at hell .
As you can see , in this Push-Pull Super Set the entire chest-back-shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises so the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time ! !
he just can't do anything about it at all ! !
But as you can also see , it's not a painful exercise at all , because Henri De Courcy -- the `` happy '' bodybuilder -- looks as though he were having the time of his life ! !
So with four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No. 1 , four of No. 2 , four of No. 3 and four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press , you can see that Henri De Courcy has had a terrific mass-building , muscle-shaping , torso-defining workout that cannot be improved upon .
Now good definition is one thing that all of us can acquire with occasional high-set , high-rep , light-weight workouts .
Indeed , a lighter weight works much better because a greater , more extensive split can be performed .
Try that late winter pickup when you are so tired of cold and snow that you feel you just can't take another day of it .
The tremendous energy released by giant rocket engines perhaps can be felt much better than it can be heard .
We must determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves .
Therefore , if the target can significantly change its location in something less than 30 minutes , the probability of having destroyed it is drastically lowered .
Until this hunter-killer operation can be performed by spacecraft , manned aircraft appear to be the only means available to us .
The aircraft could be used to destroy other mobile , fleeting , and imprecisely located targets as well as the known , fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by missile .
Nuclear rockets can destroy airfields with ease .
Here then is our problem : aircraft are vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions which a missile is totally incapable of performing ; ;
Aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once .
Build long-range aircraft which can take off from small ( 3,000-foot ) airfields with runways .
Large , long-range bombers can be developed which would have the capability to take off from 3,000-foot runways , but they would require more powerful engines than we have today .
If the target can change its position significantly during the 30 minutes the missile is in the air on its way , the probability of the missile destroying the target is drastically reduced .
With these keen `` eyes '' and small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy , military forces can be directly attacked with minimum damage to urban areas .
On the basis of what they give us we can know how the young Caruso sang , appreciate the distinctive qualities of Parsifal under Karl Muck's baton , or sense the type of ensemble Toscanini created in his years with the New York Philharmonic .

They range from an eight-foot pram , which you can build yourself for less than $50 , to auxiliary sailboats which can cost over $100,000 .
In this respect , boats can be compared with houses .
There is no limit to what you can spend , yet it is easily possible to keep within a set budget .
You can cross an ocean in a fully equipped craft , sail , power , or both , or laze away a fine day in a small dinghy on a local pond .
These engines can be removed from a boat with relative ease , wherein lies their greatest advantage .
If your state has no provisions for the numbering of pleasure boats , you must apply for a number from the U.S. Coast Guard for any kind of boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more than 10 horsepower before it can be used on Federal waterways .
lack of ability and common sense can lead to just as much tragedy .
As America on wheels was responsible for an industry of motor courts , motels , and drive-in establishments where you can dine , see a movie , shop , or make a bank deposit , the ever-increasing number of boating enthusiasts have sparked industries designed especially to accommodate them .
The design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical puzzle , but once understood , the principles can be applied to any track and signal arrangement .

A guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems ; ;
It places the various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can be computed .
However , it is essential that the various mathematical symbols used in the equations be understood so that the mathematical processes can be done properly and in their correct order .
Multiplication , subtraction , and addition can then be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left end of the equation and working toward the right .
The various mathematical processes can be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places .
The answers they give can often pave the way to performance increases and , quite often , are necessary for completing entry blanks for different events .
It is good to be able to compute displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking can be computed .
Cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber volume must be measured with a liquid .
However , the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic centimeters .
Sometimes it is necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the opening but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy that it won't affect the final computation .
By using the appropriate version any one of these factors can be determined for any combination of the other three .
Tire size can be determined in several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly .

You can build this vacation cottage yourself .
It is a full scale , small , but efficient house that can become a year 'round retreat complete in every detail .
Because of the unique design by the architect Egils Hermanovski , you can build most of it in your own home workshop in your spare time .
We have developed an ingenious method of interlocking these so that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop , panel by panel , according to plan .
Thus , when you have prepared your foundation and laid the floor , these can be trucked to the site and erected with a small crew of friends in a weekend .
The roof timbers are precut and the panels standard so that the house can be completely enclosed in a matter of three or four days .
Then you can do the finishing touches at your leisure .
This can usually be found out at the nearest town hall .
If there are any major restrictions , they usually can be obtained in printed form .
Will the view be something you can live with ? ?
Note : If 1/2-inch panel board is used inside and out , or 5/8-inch one side and 3/8-inch the other , and 1/8-inch glass is used , stock lumber in Af , Af , and Af can be used in making the glass panels .

The depth gauge rod can now be set , and any number of holes bored to exact and identical depth .
Position may not be everything , but in the case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties , social and/or physical .
You can also see that the greater the proximity of the pool to your main living quarters , the greater the chance for violation of family privacy , annoying noise and the let's-make-your-house-our-club attitude .
Yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a floating lawn every time the grass is mowed .
No bottle pool is tolerated -- bottle pool being our lingo for those who come to swim and sink into our bar while protesting that they can only dunk and run .
We gently usher them to an island of tables and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides .
Our pools also have wide , shallow steps -- for the benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a ladder affords .
Of course , if your pool is close to the house , your wife can always add it to her housekeeping chores ( you hope ) .
Or you can make pool care the price of swimming for teen-agers .
You can hope against hope that come spring cleaning , your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing and furbishing .
Two men can often do the installation in a day .
You can install it yourself -- this is a central system that will cool every part of your house .
The children can have their daytime naps and hot meals , and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms .
You can forget about screens , and leave the storm windows up all year around .
Best of all , central air conditioning is something you can afford .
Like its long-lived cousin , the refrigerator , a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years or more .
It can go in out-of-the-way waste space .
If that's done , the house can be designed and oriented for best operation , and this can mean savings both in the size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself .
If you can't see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building , by all means make provision for its easy adding later .
If your house is to have a forced warm air system , cooling can be a part of it .
You can get year-'round air conditioners in the same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone -- high or low boy , horizontal or counterflow .
The units can be installed in basement , attic , crawlspace , or in a closet located in the living area .
You can get a hot water system that will also work for cooling your house .
In a long , rambling ranch , two such units can be installed , one serving the living area , the other the sleeping zone .
One of the more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched to heating .
You can get this added heating feature for as little as $200 more than the price of cooling alone .
The body is a heat machine , and 20 to 25 guests can easily double your cooling load .
A BTU is a unit of heat , and the BTU rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can pump out of your house in an hour .
Before it cycles on again , humidity can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature is still low .
Attention to details can cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately .
A well-designed , 1200-square-foot house can be comfortably cooled and heated for as little as $128 a year , or $11 a month .
If the house you plan to buy or build won't have big overhangs , you can still do a fair job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed trellises , fences and awnings .
Shade trees , too , are a big help , so keep them if you can .
The way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence how much cooling you're going to need .
A shift in the walls , or a change in the roof slope , so the sun hits them more obliquely , can save you money .
You can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the sun , double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation .
It's no use pretending that all conditioners are quiet , but the noise they produce can be kept to a minimum .
With such a program you can make constructive selections of the best sites available .
A visit to the site by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area .
How well can the site be developed ? ?
Water interest is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation site .
Other natural features which can be of high interest are the forests , canyons , mountains , deserts , seacoast , beaches , sand dunes , waterfalls , springs , etcetera with which the area is blessed .
A group of native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can be featured at the site .
Each area has its own historical interests with which much can be done .
Those which tell a story of the earth's formation in each area can add geological interest to the recreation sites .
How well can the site be developed ? ?
Look at the physical features of the land to determine how desirable it is for use , what can be done to correct the faults , and what it will cost to make the area meet your needs in comparison to other sites .
-- The size of the area alone can be a determining factor .
I remember Ernest Bloch in the foyer , shouting in his high-pitched voice : `` it may be a tour de force , mais mon Dieu , can anyone take this music seriously '' ? ?
Nor can anyone be certain that Prokofieff would have done better , or even as well , under different circumstances .
Out of long experience I have found that incidental figures and other objects like trees , logs , and bushes can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they occupy the right position , which I call clicking .
`` Speed in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity and crispness , but unless the artist has lots of experience so that he can control rapid execution , he would do well to take these first sketches and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition .
From this point , I paint in as direct a manner as possible , by flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as I can manage .
In my studio I work at a tilt-top table , but leave the paper unfixed so that I can move it freely to control the washes .
Long observation has taught Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes : a foreground in sharp focus -- either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with lights ; ;
But if it is important , what can we do to improve ourselves ? ?
It is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem , for just as gymnastics can learn from dance , dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics .
Another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life .
Dance teachers can respond to President Kennedy's request not only through their regular dance work , but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes for strength and flexibility .
Those children who can chin themselves should be told to do one chin-up each time they pass under it .
When they can take ten seconds to accomplish the descent , they will have the strength to chin-up .
The push-up itself can be taught by starting at the top of the push-up with legs spread wide .
At first each child should do a kick-up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work alone , and those who need help .
Eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough so that the teacher can catch the leading leg .
Later this can be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover .
Improvement can be measured by the lessening distance between toes and head .
This used to be part of every child's bag of tricks , but few children can do it today ; ;
For most small children , learning a forward roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can .
These are beginnings , but correctly learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can be performed by a strong , flexible body ( we are not talking of eccentric extremes ) .
And dancing school , so helpful in artistic and psychological development , also contributes to this essential early training -- and can contribute even more .
The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery .
This unit , affectionately dubbed `` The Monster '' , can be wheeled to any convenient location and provides a wealth of information about the patient's breathing .
From the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail .
Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy .
The Doppler effect , using ultrasonic signals , can be employed to measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel .
From this doctors can read heart rate , change in diameter , pressure , and effective heart power .
These frequencies are amplified and detected by the FM receiver after each burst of transmitted energy and , after the `` pill '' has been calibrated , precise internal pressure indications can be obtained .
One of the advantages of this method is that the `` pill '' can remain in the patient for several days , permitting observation under natural conditions .
He can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate blindness due to glaucoma .

How can you cash in on this fast-growing type of outlet and still maintain relationships with older existing outlets which are still important ? ?
If you have a higher-quality product , how can you make it stand out -- justify its premium price -- without the spoken word ? ?
In your sales force , will a smaller number of higher-priced , high-quality salesmen serve you best , or can you make out better with a larger number of lower-paid salesmen ? ?
Will your trade customers settle for less attention and fewer frills in return for some benefit they can share ? ?
Distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties -- and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job .
If competition beats you to it , this exciting new product era can have real headaches in store .
Are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization ; ;
who can develop reliable estimates of sales volume , production , and distribution costs ; ;
and translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which management can act on with some assurance ? ?
With greater investments in plant facilities , with automation growing , you can't switch around , either in volume or in product design , as much as was formerly possible -- or at least not as economically .
Working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may please the public relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior design .
Even the `` history of furniture '' can hardly be taught exclusively from photographs and lantern slides .
The professional organizations such as American Institute of Interior Designers , National Society of Interior Designers , Home Fashions League and various trade associations , can and do aid greatly in this work .
No one can deny that these `` back door '' admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents to membership in supposedly learned societies .
This kind of irresponsibility toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer .
The proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only if this standard is observed .
Can you consider restricting any additional employee benefits to those paid for by profit-sharing money , such as was done in the union contract recently signed by American Motors Corporation ? ?
Can your insurance company aid you in reducing administrative costs ? ?
Can staggered lunch periods relieve the capacity strain on your feeding facilities ? ?
If you use parking attendants , can they be replaced by automatic parking gates ? ?
If you provide inter-plant transportation , can this be replaced by available public transportation ? ?
Can they be re-scheduled ? ?
Can part-time drivers be assigned to other productive work ? ?
Can vacations be spaced throughout the 12 months to minimize the number of employee fill-ins ? ?
What can your sales and purchasing departments do to curtail orders , shipments , and receipts during vacation shutdown periods ? ?
Can you share medical facilities and staff with neighboring plants ? ?
If you have a full-time doctor now , can he be replaced with a part-time doctor or one who serves on a fee-per-case basis only ? ?
Can your plant nurse be replaced by a trained first-aid man who works full-time on some other assignment ? ?
Consider what you can afford to spend and what your goals are before setting up or revamping your employee benefit program .
These factors can make the difference between waste and efficiency in any benefit program .
This can be done by stories in your house organs , posters , special publications , letters to workers' homes as well as by word of mouth through your chain of command .
Check to see if some of your benefits -- such as on-the-job disability pay -- can be put on a direct payment rather than an insured basis at a savings to you .
It can put an end to marginal claims which play havoc with your insurance rates .
Coffee breaks can be a real headache if not regulated .
Vending machines can alleviate the long hike to the cafeteria during the break with resulting waste of production time .
Keep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsmen such as tool and die makers can be kept on the job for the convenience of the company .
And so deadheads on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest possible age .
And they can at least collect the money they put in , plus interest , when they leave the company .
For example , the Friday after Thanksgiving can be substituted for Washington's birthday .
Here is the promise of a vacation trip they can afford .
The automobile expenses are about the only vacationing cost they can't either eliminate or pare down drastically by camping along the way .
Where Americans used to think of a single vacation each summer , they now think about how many vacations they can have .
forcing them into management can only create trouble .
What can be done for the `` individual contributor '' who is extremely important -- and likely to be more so -- in the operation of the technically oriented company ? ?
It is , as one engineer says , `` indeed a difficult thing for the engineer to accept that he can go as far on his technical merit as he could employing managerial skills .
This difficulty arises even though we can give examples of men who have actually followed this course .
It is doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result entirely from company efforts .
The major gets the assured gallonage for the life of the lease and the distributor apparently can do well because delivery cost is low .
Of course , you'll want to use the softest water you can in your radiators .
Dow says that the fluid can be used now for two years .
There's a good chance you are doubling on some coverage , not taking discounts coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut .
Look for these features which may mean you can save :
This means that if your insured vehicle is laid up for more than 30 days , insurance can be suspended and a proportionate return of your premium made to you .
Usually premium reductions can be obtained by applying deductibles to your liability plan .
There is much that many industries can continue to learn from some of the more recent developments described below .
Evidence of this trend can best be seen in the recent activities of such leading companies in the field as Advance Neon Sign Co. , Los Angeles , Calif. .
Panels with outdated copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied .
Thus the film can be applied to back-lighted translucent plastics faces ; ;
they can also be applied to opaque panels for use on cutouts , or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin faces .
You can save all that shimming time if you set your windows in one , two , three order -- first the stud on one side , then the window , then the stud on the other side .
That way he can truck his parts right indoors and unload them under the roof .
It makes it easy to handle much heavier units , so you can plan to build with much bigger and heavier prefabricated components like those shown in the pictures alongside .
It lessens the need for costly on-site fabrication and increases the chance for shop fabrication , where almost everything can be made better and cheaper .
For example , instead of putting in your driveways last ( as many builders do ) you can now save money by putting them in first .
Instead of closing the house in first ( as most builders do ) you can now cut your costs by not closing it in until you have to ( see p 121 ) .
But now many of these same builders are finding they can cut their costs more by teaming up with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most efficient specialized equipment to deliver everything just where it is needed -- drywall inside the house , siding along the sides , trusses on the walls , roofing on the roof , etc. .
Practically all bulky housing products can now be ordered in standard units palletized or unitized for mechanical handling -- including lumber , asphalt shingles , glass block , face brick , plaster , lime , hardboard , gypsum wallboard and sheathing , cement , insulation sheathing , floor tile , acoustical tile , plaster base , and asbestos shingles .
`` With a 15,500-lb. fork-lift , dealers can unload unitized lumber from wide-door box cars for $.30/mbf compared with $1.65 or more to unload loose lumber one piece at a time '' , says James Wright of Aj .
More unitized lumber is being shipped on flat cars , and NLRDA studies show that flat cars loaded with the new Type 6-B floating-load method can be unloaded for as little as $.054/mbf .
This costs from $.75 to $2.30/mbf , but the cover can pay off if the lumber is to be stored in the open .
And it helps the builder because it can handle a more efficiently packaged load , can deliver it to the best spot ( in some cases , right on the roof or inside the house ) , and never takes any of the builder's high-priced labor to help unload it .
Reports Jim Lendrum : `` By studying men on the job , we found that two men -- a carpenter and a helper -- can lay a floor faster than three .
We found that three men -- two carpenters and a helper -- can put up wall panels or trusses more economically than four men -- because four men don't make two teams ; ;
We found that wherever you can use two teams on a job , five men , not four , is the magic number '' .
This is the most penny-wise , pound-foolish chisel a builder can commit .
You can relive history and follow , in fancy , the Crusaders in their quest for the Holy Grail as they sail out from Brindisi , an ancient town in the heel of Italy's boot .
For those who need or want and can afford another car , buying one and driving it on the grand tour , then shipping it home , is one popular plan for a do-it-yourself pilgrimage .
You can call one of the car rental services directly ( Hertz , Avis , Auto-Europe Nationalcar Rental , and others ) and ask them to reserve a car of your choice , and some transportation lines offer this service as well .
You can wait , of course , until you arrive in Europe before renting your car .
For those who plan to travel to Europe by one route and return by another some agencies offer a service whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival and leave it in another city , or even another country , when you are ready to return home .
If you plan to visit any of these countries , you can obtain your International Driving Permit before you leave at a nominal fee -- around $3.00 .
There is a fairly wide selection of models of English , German and French manufacture from which you can choose from the very small Austin 7 , Citroen 2 CV , Volkswagens , Renaults to the 6-passenger Simca Beaulieu .
In other words , like automation machines designed to work in tandem , they shared the same programming , a mutual understanding not only of English words , but of the four stresses , pitches , and junctures that can change their meaning from black to white .
but consider , if you can bear it , what might have happened if MacArthur , for some perverse , undaunted reason , had made the same remark to an Eskimo girl in Eskimo .
At a minimum , recording -- usually on tape , which is now in wide professional use -- brings the psychiatric interview alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapists .
Interpretation , naturally , remains the role of the therapist , but orientation -- not only the patient's vocal giveaways of geographical and socio-economic background , but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways of danger spots in his relationship to people -- can be considerably beefed up by the linguist .
The word that is not used can be as important as the word that is used ; ;
We can't expect any help from the fighters at Foggia , either .
I can't tell when , but I'm positive I witnessed this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in the past '' ! !
There is nothing to suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original , realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams .
The entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a mental image can find no logical support .
But then this theory confesses that it is completely at a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain .
`` You can't make French toast with whole-wheat bread '' , was an early complaint .
Where can we get this cereal he likes so much '' ? ?
Miss Colman hopes to find suitable shakers so that kelp can be available at the tables .
Since the change to better nutrition , he feels he can report on improvements in health , though he considers the following statements observations and not scientific proof .
`` But Fogg '' , they countered , `` we can't get over there .
Also you can spell , without consulting a dictionary for every other word .
Actually , you can take no special credit for this .
You can sit back and moan and bewail your lot .
You can do this .
Many of you will say , `` Well , what can I do '' ? ?
If you can't think of a thing to do , try something -- anything .
I , frankly , can't draw a straight line .
Some women can sit and sew , crochet , tat or knit by the hour , and look calm and relaxed and turn out beautiful work .
Some people can carve most anything out of a piece of wood .
I can look at furniture in one spot year in and year out and really feel for sure that's where it belongs .
I can hear some of you folks protesting .
Travel , if you can .
It has been truly said that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by projecting this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world .
Not only can man project his imagination out into his environment in concrete forms , but even more importantly , he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself .
We recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training can become athletes , acrobats , dancers , musicians and artists , developing many potentialities .
We know that actors can learn to portray a wide variety of character roles .
By this same combination of the will and the imagination , each one of us can learn to portray permanently the kind of character we would like to be .
We must realize with Prof. Charles Morris in his The Open Self that `` Man is the being that can continually remake himself , the artisan that is himself the material for his own creation '' .
So far in history man has been too greatly over-occupied with projecting things into his environment rather than first creating the sort of person who can make the highest use of the things he has created .
Is not the present world crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall the tragedy .
Various factors in the setting can still be of great advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather than a bad memory for one or both .
It is far better to have such conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the honeymoon where they can create a really serious situation .
Folk-lore , superstition and remembered passages from erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly taken as scientific facts and useful hints .
Ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride , both physically and psychologically .
The necessity for keeping alert to his bride's hazards can act as an interference with the man's spontaneous desire .
Or the frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period .
This may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding and self-centered .
He can take security from the fact that the progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost .
Now while he uses talk , caresses or requires caresses from her , his bride will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they both so eagerly desire .
Beyond a certain point , of course , no woman can be dominant -- nature has seen to that .
Yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous .
It can , in fact , wreck a marriage .
`` A marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband's maleness '' , declares Dr. Calderone .
`` When the roles of husband and wife are reversed , so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower '' , Dr. Linden says , `` the effects on their whole relationship , sexual and otherwise , can be disastrous '' .
Experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed .
Hemmed in on the job and unable to assert himself , he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area .
Naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative .
In some cases , however , domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary , triggered by a passing but urgent emotional need .
Thus a man who is butting a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed -- the one place he can still be champion .
In any case , Dr. Calderone remarks , such problems are a couple's own affair , and can't always be measured by a general yardstick .
After a few minutes he said , `` I can't use you if you dance like that .
`` You can't do this to us '' , Diane screamed .
Of course , her benevolence was limited to those who could afford it , but then there is a limit to what one person can do .
But as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing to worry about .
He then sold her minerals to cure her kidney ailment , a can of sage `` to make her look like a girl again '' , and an application of plain mud to take her wrinkles away .
But the machine quack can cause far more than just suffering .
In such diseases as cancer , tuberculosis , and heart disease , early diagnosis and treatment are so vital that the waste of time by the patient with Doctor Fraud's cure-all gadget can prove fatal .
Moreover , the diabetic patient who relies on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake can be committing suicide .
That's where device quackery can lead .
How can they tell whether a child needs orthodontic treatment ? ?
Malocclusion can also result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long .
Correction can save teeth
`` For these and other reasons '' , says Dr. Brodie , `` orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth '' .
Badly placed teeth can also cause such a speech handicap as lisping .
What can 10-year-old Susan expect when she enters the orthodontist's office ? ?
`` If teeth are moved too rapidly , serious injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding bone holding them in place '' , explains Dr. Brodie .
`` Moving one or two teeth can affect the whole system , and an ill-conceived plan of treatment can disrupt the growth pattern of a child's face '' .
`` Fortunately through our growth studies we have been able to see what nature does , and that helps us know what we can do '' .
Now a dentist can recommend extraction immediately .
To help prevent orthodontic problems from arising , your dentist can do these things :
He can correct decay , thus preventing early loss of teeth .
The mediums with whom the Parapsychology Foundation is working in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated state , so that the sitter can make comments , ask and answer questions , instead of talking with a `` control '' who speaks through an entranced sensitive .
All he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner , seeking to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal impressions .
It is now harder to assume telepathy as a basis for the statements -- though research still does not know how far afield ESP can range .
Here again laboratory approaches are being evolved , for it is recognized how `` elastic '' these readings can be , how they can apply to many people , and are often stated in general terms all too easily applied to any individual's own case .
An interested sitter may think the sensitive has made a `` hit '' , describing something accurately for him , but can he really be sure that another sitter , hearing the same statement , would not apply it subjectively to his own circumstances ? ?
`` A journey '' , `` a little white house '' , `` a change of outlook '' , can apply to many people .
And even more complex items can be interpreted to conform to one's own point of view , which is by nature so personal .
If he is not told which of four or five readings was meant for him , he can more readily assess each item in a larger frame : `` Does that statement really sound as if it were for me , significant in my particular life ? ?
So each reading can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding up these weights .
And there are some positive results , though the final findings will not be known for a long time -- and then further research can be formulated .
Now when , so to speak , the cream has been skimmed off , and the items in the successful categories separated out , the sitter can be asked to consider and rate only this concentrated `` cream '' , where the sensitive is at her best .
If asked how she gets her impressions , she probably can only say that she `` just gets them '' -- some more vividly than others .
No matter how well work is planned , bad weather or unexpected setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up .
It may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably .
A part-time farmer needs unusual skill to get as high production per hen , per cow , or per acre as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer .
The children can do chores adapted to their age and ability .
A part-time farmer and his family can use their spare time profitably .
Part-time farming can take comparatively little land , labor , and equipment -- or a great deal .
But consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your other work .
If you have a year-round , full-time job you can't expect to grow much more than your family uses -- unless other members of the family do a good deal of the work or you hire help .
In deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor , compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1 .

Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-Jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors .
This conclusion is based on two propositions : that man by the use of his reason can ascertain God's purpose in the universe and that God makes known His purpose by certain `` given '' physical arrangements .
Thus , man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act is procreation , the propagation of the race .
`` As to the necessity '' , the committee declared , `` for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the spacing of children , and consequently of control of conception , there can be no question .
A Reb stationed near Petersburg informed his mother : `` I need not tell you that I dodge pretty often for you can see that very plainly by the blots in this letter .
One can apply these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine , and they can be applied again to the United States in more recent years .
As long as his material is Americana , can in some way be ascribed to the masses and appears `` democratic '' to his audience , he remains satisfied .
From all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentieth-century American folklore .
Both are primarily concerned with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector has found .
The commercial propagandist , who can't afford to be critical , gets along well with the amateur , from whom he feeds , but he frequently steps on the analyst's toes by refusing to keep his material genuine .

I speak of `` the largest possible measure '' because any person who supposes that these conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved -- ever -- reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human beings , and is therefore a dangerous man to have around .
It may be , of course , that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism ; ;
If we look at the situation this way , we can get an idea of Khrushchev's nightmarish worries -- or , at least , of the worries he might have if his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage .
The contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign , but once that has been done , I fail to see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it .

Undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower grades in this regard in the Negro schools .
However , the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family is anti-intellectual .
Quite the contrary , as I can testify from personal experience as a former university president .

The other misconception is that our ecumenical problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide extension and its interdenominational connections , now comprehended by many national leaders , can be communicated to all congregations .
It is , he said , a bifocal vision , which can see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a Christian in right relation to both .

Unless one takes refuge in the theory -- however disguised -- that Negroes are , somehow , different from white people , I do not see how one can escape the conclusion that the Negro's status in this country is not only a cruel injustice but a grave national liability .
What I find appalling -- and really dangerous -- is the American assumption that the Negro is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest .
It is a notion which contains a gratuitous insult , implying , as it does , that Negroes can make no move unless they are manipulated .
Motion-picture exhibitions took place in stores in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can still be found in such urban areas as Times Square .
A congregation survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership ; ;
that is , when it can preserve economic integration .
Religious faith can be considered a necessary condition of membership in a congregation , since the decision to join a worshiping group requires some motive force , but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining ; ;
they can lose higher- and lower-status members from the church without collapsing , but they need adequate recruits for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration .
They survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers .
The rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations .
it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in order to strengthen an organization .
Churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration ; ;
The inner life of congregations will prosper so long as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together ; ;
the schism between central city and suburb , Negro and White , blue collar and white collar can be viewed as symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis .
It could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain religious activity , since worship presupposes some local stabilities .

One of the sit-in leaders has said : `` Nobody from the top of Heaven to the bottom of Hell can stop the march to freedom .
Not only should this provision be enforced but other economic and political actions might be taken which , this author believes , `` must surely be supported by every American who values the freedom that has been won for him and whose conscience is not so dominated by the lines in his account books that he can willingly and knowingly contribute to the enslavement of another nation '' .
Almost febrile in intensity , the principle has become worldwide in application -- unfortunately at the very time that nationalist fervors can wreak greatest harm .

He bases his approach on the belief that anything can follow anything .
An order can be chanced rather than chosen , and this approach produces an experience that is `` free and discovered rather than bound and remembered '' .
And any sequence can not only change its positions in the work but can even be eliminated from it altogether .
he adheres to its dictates as faithfully as he can .
Nothing can show more than this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty .
When it comes to this , I shall prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty -- to Russia , for instance , where despotism can be taken pure , without the base alloy of hypocrisy '' ( His emphasis )
The one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people were acting through their states , whereas the Preamble of 1787-89 expressed , as clearly as language can , the opposite concept , that they were acting directly as citizens .
The most effective political inventions seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole scheme .
There are certainly large areas of understanding in the human sciences which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel our present fears .
This understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls .
We have staved off a war and , since our behavior has involved all these elements , we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring to abandon any part of it , since we have not the slightest notion which parts are effective .
That , I thought , is at least one thing I can find out when we meet .
It is not a mess you can make sense of '' .
One can only speak of what is in front of him , and that now is simply the mess '' .
But now we can keep it out no longer , because we have come into a time when `` it invades our experience at every moment .
How can we make sense of this division ? ?
They withdraw to the underground of the slums where they can defy the precepts of legalized propriety .
indeed , it is maintained that the sexual element in jazz , by freeing the listener of his inhibitions , can have therapeutic value .
Instead of giving themselves spontaneously to the orgiastic release that jazz can give them , they undergo psychoanalysis or flirt with mysticism or turn to prostitutes for satisfaction .
Those who are sexually liberated can become creatively alive and free , their instincts put at the service of the imagination .
What they discuss with dialectical seriousness is the degree to which sex can inspire the Muse .
The professed mission of this disaffiliated generation is to find a new way of life which they can express in poetry and fiction , but what they produce is unfortunately disordered , nourished solely on the hysteria of negation .
Something of this can be learned from `` The Way To The Churchyard '' ( 1901 ) , an anecdote about an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die of a stroke or seizure .
All such imitations of negative quality have given rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism : if man can neither know nor love reality as it is , he can at least invent an artistic `` reality '' which is its own world and which can speak to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved .
Similarly experience itself can be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field .
When words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds , when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves , compelling the observer into an attitude of attention , all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance .
Underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which require some exposition before the main argument can proceed .
But people can't be made to integrate , socialize ( the two are inseparable by Southern standards ) by law .
it can be changed ; ;
One can meet with aloofness almost anywhere : the THIDIU viewpoint , It Doesn't Affect Us ! !
You've already sent your daughter to Miss X's select academy for girls and your son to Mr. Y's select academy for boys , and you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity .
A dear , respected friend of mine , who like myself grew up in the South and has spent many years in New England , said to me not long ago : `` I can't forgive New England for rejecting all complicity '' .
But can one , really ? ?
Can God be mocked , ever , in the long run ? ?
What he really wants is to find `` a sacred cause '' to which he can honestly devote himself .
The hero , who is himself , is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the East , a sort of Faustus type , who , to quote from Professor Book again , `` even in the pleasure gardens of Sardanapalus can not cease from his painful search after the meaning of life .
In scope and power it can only be compared to Tolstoy's War And Peace .
Surrounded by crime and violence everywhere , the `` hardboiled '' private eye can retain his purity only through a life of self-imposed isolation .
However , for convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classified according to Table 1 .
The completeness of the connections provide that , for N people , there are Af lines of communication between the pairs , which can become a large number ( 1,225 ) for a party of fifty guests .
We assume for this illustration that the size of the land plots is so great that the distance between dwellings is greater than the voice can carry and that most of the communication is between nearest neighbors only , as shown in Figure 2 .
Since the hazards of poor communication are so great , p can be justified as a habitable site only on the basis of unusual productivity such as is made available by a waterfall for milling purposes , a mine , or a sugar maple camp .
This monitoring is necessary because , on a parade ground , everyone can hear too much , and without monitoring a confused social event would develop .
The assumptions upon which the example shown in Figure 3 is based are : ( A ) One man can direct about six subordinates if the subordinates are chosen carefully so that they do not need too much personal coaching , indoctrinating , etc. .
This is an unsolved problem which probably has never been seriously investigated , although one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists of the kind who can compete with the Germans or Swiss , for example , in precision machinery and mathematics , or the Finns in geochemistry .
We hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have not enough generalists who can see the over-all picture and combine our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes .
This problem of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of generalists and specialists can be investigated on a communicative network basis .
But , for practical purposes , we have people who can be considered as such .
And I select this sentence as its pertinent summation : `` in essence the drama of his ( Eisenhower's ) Presidency can be described as the ordeal of a nation turned conservative and struggling -- thus far with but limited and precarious success -- to give effective voice and force to that conservatism '' .
What I am here to do is to report on the gyrations of the struggle -- a struggle that amounts to self-redefinition -- to see if we can predict its future course .
One of the obvious conclusions we can make on the basis of the last election , I suppose , is that we , the majority , were dissatisfied with Eisenhower conservatism .
Here there may be an analogy with cancer : we can detect cancers by their rapidly accelerating growth , determinable only when related to the more normal rate of healthy growth .
Hence the prime issue , as I see it , is whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind , or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible with its own needs as a force of nature .
But even if we cannot see the repulsive characteristics in this new image of America , foreigners can ; ;
So we are faced with a vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever manner they can , without regard to the needs of society , controlling society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation's needs for survival .
Avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society ; ;
Such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can offer , corporations cannot .
It can project long-range goals for itself .
Proprietorships can establish a unity and integrity of control ; ;
Proprietorships can establish a meaningful identity , representing a human personality , and thus establish sincere relationships with customers and community .
Men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences of the most varied , complicated and trying type so that at maturation they have developed the competence and willingness to accept the personal responsibility so sorely needed now .
If we cannot stop warfare in our own economic system , how can we expect to abolish it internationally ? ?
Can they stand rigid scrutiny ? ?
But is the result new barnsful of tested knowledge on the basis of which we can with confidence solve our domestic and international problems ? ?
In truth , we can say that this broke the power of Senator Joseph McCarthy , who was finally exposed in full light to the American people .
Debate in the political arena can be productive of good .
But it is a clumsy and wasteful process : it can produce negative results but not much that is positive .
In the field of the natural sciences , scientifically verified data are quite readily available and any discussion can be shortened with good results .
In the field of the social sciences a considerable fund of tested knowledge has been accumulated that can be used to good advantage .
In no other situation would a group of doctors , struggling competently to improve the life expectancy of a man beloved by the world , be subjected to such merciless and persistent questioning , and before they were prepared to demonstrate the kind of verbal precision which alone can clarify for mankind the problems it faces .
And though we can look back now and see their errors , we can look back also to the ultimate error .
Yet the attitude that the fate of the Presidency demands in such a situation is quite distinct from the simple courage that can proceed with battles to be fought , regardless of the consequences .
Only when that term is ended and he is a private citizen again can he be permitted the freedom and the courage to discount the dangers of his death .
He ascribes to the mercy of God the peace which this personal matter -- the assurance that he can physically sustain the burden of the office longer than any individual in the history of our nation has been able to do -- has brought him .
Only by means of an intensive preoccupation with the detailed considerations following from any decision can he ensure attention to the practical details to be dealt with if the implications of immorality in the major decision are effectively to be checked .
Like Lincoln , he can distinguish his relation to God from the constitutional responsibilities a questionable decision exacts of him .
Like Roosevelt , he can distinguish an attitude toward a Russian leader he may share with a host of Americans from the responsibilities diplomatic convention may impose upon him .
The capacity for making the distinctions of which diplomacy is compact , and the facility with language which can render them into validity in the eyes of other men are the leader's means for transforming the moral intuition into moral leadership .
Only recently , and perhaps because a television debate can so effectively dramatize President Kennedy's extraordinary mastery of detail , have the abilities on which the capacity for making distinctions depend begun to be clearly discernible at the level of politics .
There the community , faced with the need to formulate policy on the level of absolute justice , can find the answer to its problem in the absolute truth which it holds as partially experienced .
Precisely at the moment when it has lost its vision the mind of the community turns out from itself in a search for the ontological standard whereby it can measure itself .
Thus , it is no mystical intuition , but an analyzable conception to say that man and his tradition can `` fall out of existence '' .
This means that the inception of change itself can begin only when the factors conducive to change have already become more powerful than those anchoring the existent form in being .
The most reaction can achieve is stasis , and a stasis that can be maintained only by the expenditure of an effort which ultimately exhausts itself .
Now we can argue that the irresistible fate of Oedipus Rex was nothing more than the irresistible unconscious longings of Oedipus projected outward , but this externalization of unconscious conflict makes all the difference between a story and a clinical case history .
We can also argue that the three brothers Karamazov and Smerdyakov were the external representatives of an internal conflict within one man , Dostoevsky , a conflict having to do with father-murder and the wish to possess the father's woman .
Whatever the psychological truth in the Oedipus myth , an Oedipus who is drawn to his fate by irresistible external forces can carry the symbol of humanity and its archaic crime , and the incest that is unknowing renews the mystery of the eternal dream of childhood and absorbs us in the secret .
And if we understand the rocking as an erotic symbol we can also see how well it serves as the symbol of impending tragedy .
But a writer who has a taste for irony and who sees incest in all its modern dimensions can let his imagination work on the disturbing joke in the incest myth , the joke that strikes right at the center of man's humanness .
He has employed from his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be termed Southern .
Without saying or seeming to say that in portraying the Sartoris and the Compson families Faulkner's chief concern is social criticism , we can say nevertheless that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the planter dynasties as they have existed since the decades before the Civil War .
One of the early humorists already mentioned , Thomas Bangs Thorpe , can be used to illustrate another point where Faulkner touches authentic Southern materials and also earlier literary treatment of those materials .
As a Humanist , Dr. Huxley interests himself in the possibilities of human development , and one thing we can say about this suggestion , which comes from a leading zoologist , is that , so far as he is concerned , the scientific outlook places no rigid limitation upon the idea of future human evolution .
Even if people do , in a not far distant future , begin to read one another's minds , there will still be the question of whether what you find in another man's mind is especially worth reading -- worth more , that is , than what you can read in good books .
He can sacrifice himself for tomorrow and he can sacrifice tomorrow for himself .
There is essential pleasantness in reading the writing of men who are not angry , who can contend without quarreling .
One thing you can say about Mr. Lyford is that he does not suffer from any insecurity as an American .
If our sincerity is granted , and it is granted , the discrepancy can only be explained by the fact that we have come to believe hearsay and legend about ourselves in preference to an understanding gained by earnest self-examination .
We feel uncomfortable at being bossed by a corporation or a union or a television set , but until we have some knowledge about these phenomena and what they are doing to us , we can hardly learn to control them .
The men who speculate on these institutions have , for the most part , come to at least one common conclusion : that many of the great enterprises and associations around which our democracy is formed are in themselves autocratic in nature , and possessed of power which can be used to frustrate the citizen who is trying to assert his individuality in the modern world '' .
Of one thing we can be sure : they were not sketched out by the revolutionary theorists of the eighteenth century who formulated the political principles and originally shaped the political institutions of what we term the `` free society '' .
No doubt there are historians who can explain to a great extent what happened to the plans and projects of the eighteenth century .
Without careful qualification this can be misleading .
Analogously , anyone who argues that Einstein's theory of gravitation is simpler than Newton's , must say rather more to explain how it is that the latter is mastered by student-physicists , while the former can be managed ( with difficulty ) only by accomplished experts .
The Axioms required to make the theoretical machinery operate are set out tersely and powerfully , so that all permissible operations within the theory can be traced rigorously back to these axioms , rules , and primitive notions .
But , considered within technical astronomy , a different pattern can be traced .
She had the opportunity that few clever women can resist , of showing her superiority in argument over a man .
She was exposing herself to temptation which it is best to avoid where it can consistently be done .
the moral powers no more than the physical and mental , can bear overstraining .
The misery of Miriam's bitterness can be felt today by anyone who studies the case -- it was hopeless , agonizing , and destructive , with Miriam herself bearing the heaviest burden of shame and pain .
Miriam had not yet goaded him into mentioning her directly , but one can feel the generalized anger in Wright's remarks to reporters when he was asked , one morning on arrival in Chicago , what he thought of the city as a whole .
how can he be financed so that he can find the work he ought to do ? ?
If Mrs. Wright doesn't accept the terms in the morning , I'll go either to Tokyo or to Holland , to do what I can .
Here Wright gave a slight sigh of weariness , and continued , `` It means more long years lived across the social grain of the life of our people , making shift to live in the face of popular disrespect and misunderstanding as I best can for myself and those dependent upon me '' .
Perhaps the mere fact that by plucking on the nerves nature can awaken in the most ordinary of us , temporarily anyway , the sleeping poet , and in poets can discover their immortality , is the most remarkable of all the remarkable phenomena to which we can attest ? ?
One can see it as humiliating that an extra hormone casually fed into our chemistry may induce us to lay down our lives for a lover or a friend ; ;
one can take it as no more than another veil torn from the mystery of the soul .
But all this , I am well aware , is the bel canto of love , and although I have always liked to think that it was to the bel canto and to that alone that I listened , I know well enough that it was not .
I can see us now .
But I can see from this latest trick of memory how much more arbitrary and influential it is than the will .
Helpless in that sense I can never be again .
But when these expectations are once too often ground into the dust , innocence can falter , since its strength is according to the strength of him who possesses it .
Well you can pose inside .
A rich nation can for a time , without noticeable damage to itself , pursue a course of self-indulgence , making its single goal the material ease and comfort of its own citizens -- thus repudiating its own spiritual and material stake in a peaceful and prosperous society of nations .
Moreover , progress in a national transformation can be only gradually earned ; ;
As a nation we can successfully pursue these objectives only from a position of broadly based strength .
`` You know '' , the lawyer said , `` it's difficult to talk like this about a man who can't answer back '' .
No organization can carry on like that .
`` I've been in government and I can tell some pretty hairy stories about personnel difficulties , so I know what a problem he was '' .
You can find it in the papers '' .
I can hardly think of this simple fare without exclaiming , oh , what a luxury .
`` He looks as feminine as you can imagine '' , she decided .
It is , however , a disarming disguise , or perhaps a shield , for not only has Mercer proved himself to be one of the few great lyricists over the years , but also one who can function remarkably under pressure .
`` I can tell you this much '' , he said .
I still have the dress , and I hope to give it to the Smithsonian Institution as a memento , or , as I more fondly hope , to present it to a museum containing articles showing the daily lives of the Presidents -- if I can get it organized .
You can imagine that he got pretty good service .
Conventional images of Jews have this in common with all perceptions of a configuration in which one feature is held constant : images can be both true and false .
In accounting for realism or distortion two sets of factors can be usefully distinguished : current intelligence ; ;
Since we can neither undo nor redo the past , we are limited to the events of today and tomorrow .
the process can be accelerated .
As more men and women are made capable of living up to the challenge of decency the chances are improved that the pattern of predisposition prevailing in positions of strength in future crises can be favorably affected .
An advantage of being exposed to such specificity about an important and recurring feature of social reality is that it can be taken advantage of by the reader to examine covert as well as overt resonances within himself , resonances triggered by explicit symbols clustering around the central figure of the Jew .
In fact , I can only say this seems to me to follow from a wide , continuous , and properly guided exposure to literary art .
By an effort of historical sympathy we can cast our minds back into the art of a remote past or an alien present , and enjoy the carvings of cavemen and Japanese colour-prints ; ;
Of course , it goes without saying that no student of ideas can justifiably ignore the contemporary scene .
But , in general , we may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of his attention toward one or the other .
After all , Shelley is no `` orthodox '' or Hellenic Platonist , and even his `` romantic '' Platonism can be distinguished from that of his contemporaries .
`` History has this in common with every other science : that the historian is not allowed to claim any single piece of knowledge , except where he can justify his claim by exhibiting to himself in the first place , and secondly to any one else who is both able and willing to follow his demonstration , the grounds upon which it is based .
Certainly one of the most important comments that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural life of any period of Western civilization during the past sixteen or seventeen centuries has to do with the way in which its leaders have read and interpreted the Bible .
A contrast of the scripture reading of , let us say , St. Augustine , John Bunyan , and Thomas Jefferson , all three of whom found in such study a real source of enlightenment , can tell us a great deal about these three men and the age that each represented and helped bring to conscious expression .
We must avoid the notion , suggested to some people by examples such as those just mentioned , that ideas are `` units '' in some way comparable to coins or counters that can be passed intact from one group of people to another or even , for that matter , from one individual to another .
If within one year you can make a success out of the American , you can practically name your own salary thereafter .
`` Mr. Lane '' , Hearst said , `` if you ever wish anything that I can do , all you will have to do will be to send me a telegram asking , and it will be done '' .
`` Mr. Hearst '' , Lane replied as he left , `` if you ever get a telegram from me asking you to do anything , you can put the telegram down as a forgery '' .
There can be little doubt that there was a conspiracy in Washington , overt or implied , to block anything Hearst wanted , even if it was something good .
`` Does any sane Democrat believe that Mr. Hearst , a person unknown even to his constituency and his colleagues , without a word or act in the public life of his country , past or present , that can be shown to be his to commend him , could by any possibility be elected President of the United States ? ?
If it is not one of his best books , it can only be considered unsatisfactory when compared with his own Garibaldi .
`` But if there is no line , how can there be two countries ? ?
I've had a trying day and I just can't make it out again '' , I told them .
In any case , she told Thompson that she saw no reason why he might not see Katie again , `` now that this frank explanation has been made & no one can misunderstand '' .
The publication of Father Connolly's The Man Has Wings has made more of the group available in print so that a general picture of what it contained can now be had without difficulty .
Taking into account Thompson's capacity for self-dramatization and the possibility of a wish to identify his own life with the misfortunes of other poets who had known unhappy loves , there can be no doubt about his genuine emotion for Katie King .
Furthermore I can identify each design .
How can a cat be thin in a fish restaurant ? ?
If Robinson was a liar and a slanderer , he was also a very canny gentleman , for nothing that Pike could do would pry so much as a single word out of him .
From his first bout with the canny Woodruff , Pike had learned that it was better not to attack him directly , so , harping on the theme that the cost of printing was too high , he condemned the governor for permitting such a state of affairs to exist .
One can imagine that with her and Gorton there it was no place for anyone with weak nerves .
`` But why in the name of God can't I give my father blood '' ? ?
`` Why can't I , Doctor '' ? ?
In my experience the assurance of forgiveness comes only when I have confessed to the wronged one and have made as full reparation as I can devise .
We can conceive of no alternatives .
Neither the engineer nor the ordinary citizen feels any self-consciousness in obeying the laws of matter and energy , nor can he achieve a sense of self-righteousness in such obedience .
Above all read in Jens Bjerre's The Last Cannibal Show the old man of the Wailbri tribe ( not cannibals ) in central Australia gave to the white man his choicest possession , while the tears streamed down his face .
Criticism is as old as literary art and we can set the stage for our study of three moderns if we see how certain critics in the past have dealt with the ethical aspects of literature .
Only those story tellers will remain who can `` imitate the style of the virtuous '' .
We can be virtuous only if we control our lower natures , the passions in this case , and strengthen our rational side ; ;
for if this can be proved we shall surely be the gainers -- I mean , if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight '' .
The Chicago contingent of modern critics follow Aristotle so far in this direction that it is hard to see how they can compare one poem with another for the purpose of evaluation .
The point is that an ethical critic , with an assist from Freud , can seize on this theory to argue that tragedy provides us with a harmless outlet for our hostile urges .
And we can add that Krutch's interpretation of purgation is also one answer to Plato's fear that poetry will encourage our passions .
He warns that a single glance can lead us into temptation , for `` Looking eies have lyking hartes , and lyking hartes may burne in lust '' .
hence changes in attitudes and values can be analyzed for identical individuals at two points in time .
Within the fixed frame of these aspirations , they can afford to place a high value on the expressive and people-oriented aspects of occupation and to minimize the instrumental-reward values of power , prestige , and wealth .
If there be a disinterested patriot in America , 'tis General Washington , and his bravery , none can question '' .
Even so , Edward's ambassadors can scarcely have foreseen that five years of unremitting work lay ahead of them before peace was finally made and that when it did come the countless embassies that left England for Rome during that period had very little to do with it .
He was a learned and brilliant man , one of the best jurists in Europe and with flashes of penetrating insight , and yet in his dealings with other people , particularly when he tried to be ingratiating , he was capable of an abysmal stupidity that can have come only from a complete incomprehension of human nature and human motives .
The jug stayed at the hospital and the water -- what can happen to water ? ?
In sum , it can be said that the techniques and standards of present day have their origin at the turn of the century .
As Sir Charles Oman once said , `` it is no longer fashionable to declare that we can say nothing certain about Old English origins '' .
Now omitting for a moment some recent developments we can say the Saxon Shore hypothesis of Lappenberg and Kemble has undergone virtual eclipse in this century .
It might be well to consider the literary evidence first because it can provide us with an answer to one important question ; ;
But it can no longer be so once Benjamin Franklin ( the incarnation of the new rational man ) has flown a kite to it .
There can be no greater magic than to wrest from death her in whom the flesh was all , in whom beauty was entirely pure because it was entirely corruptible .
`` If you can firmly make the good knight sure to pleasure our Corporation '' , Sturley wrote , `` besides that ordinary allowance for your diet you shall have 20 for recompence '' .
Wherefore I thynke yow maye doo good yff yow can have money '' .
When the historian encounters a situation in which he can perceive no visible cause and effect sequence , he should be alert to intuition and unconscious instinct as possible guides .
Then , all but blind , he said there was nothing in Back to Methuselah -- , -- `` G.B.S. ought to have known that '' , -- and `` I look at my bookshelves despairingly , knowing that I can have nothing more to do with them '' .
Harcourt replied : `` I do really hope you can achieve serenity in the course of time .
Of course I hope Hal can also , but those hopes are much more faint '' .
That is , if we can trust that most specious of prolusions , packed as it is with wit and persiflage .
the prolusion in which the autobiographic statement about the epithet occurs is such a mass of intentionally buried allusions that almost nothing in it can be accepted as true -- or discarded as false .
Perhaps his most important private activity was the combination of reading , discussion with a few -- if we can trust his writings to Diodati and the younger Gill , very few -- congenial companions .
Writers of this class of science fiction have clearly in mind the assumptions that man can master the principles of this cause-and-effect universe and that such mastery will necessarily better the human lot .
In Arthur Clarke's Childhood's End ( 1953 ) , though written after the present flood of dystopias began , we can see the bright vision of science fiction clearly defined .
Because of the means of publication -- science-fiction magazines and cheap paperbacks -- and because dystopian science fiction is still appearing in quantity the full range and extent of this phenomenon can hardly be known , though one fact is evident : the science-fiction imagination has been immensely fertile in its extrapolations .
Walter M. Miller , Jr.'s , A Canticle For Leibowitz ( 1959 ) finds men , after the great atomic disaster , stumbling back to their previous level of civilization and another catastrophe ; ;
How effectively these warnings can be presented is seen in Pohl and Kornbluth's The Space Merchants , Vonnegut's Player Piano and Wyndham's Re-Birth .
If man is actually the product of his environment and if science can discover the laws of human nature and the ways in which environment determines what people do , then someone -- a someone probably standing outside traditional systems of values -- can turn around and develop completely efficient means for controlling people .
But the only ideal he can think of is `` Sales '' ! !
No good can come of contemplating the sad , inevitable fact that once youth has passed `` a worse and worse time still succeeds the former '' .
Many readers of this department no doubt discount certain of my opinions for the simple reason that they can guess pretty accurately , even if they have never actually been told , what my age is .
That fact is very clearly illustrated in the case of the many present-day intellectuals who were Communists or near-Communists in their youth and are now so extremely conservative ( or reactionary , as many would say ) that they can define no important political conviction that does not seem so far from even a centrist position as to make the distinction between Mr. Nixon and Mr. Khrushchev for them hardly worth noting .
so that , although not as eager as I once was to be disapproved of , I can still resist prevailing opinions .
But he , as I can now retort , was the man who could see so short a distance ahead that after a visit to Russia he gave voice to the famous exclamation : `` I have seen the future and it works '' .
I would , however , like to suggest that , wrong though I may be , the tendency to see dilemmas rather than solutions is one of which I have been a victim ever since I can remember , and therefore not merely a senile phenomenon .
It is not something that can be expected to happen now .
Punishment of the wrongdoer , so liberals are inclined to say , can have only three possible justifications : revenge , reformation or deterrent example .
But as he remarks in his preface to The Walnut Trees , `` a novel can hardly ever be rewritten '' , and `` when this one appears in its final form , the form of the first part will no doubt be radically changed '' .
Malraux , to be sure , does not abandon the world of violence , combat and sudden death which has become his hallmark as a creative artist , and which is the only world , apparently , in which his imagination can flame into life .
From this point of view the `` militant mobs '' of the past , stirred into action by one ideology or another , were all composed of `` intellectuals '' -- and this is not the level on which the essence of mankind can be discovered .
Central Asia is sunk in a somnolence from which nothing can awaken it ; ;
In a pessimistic assessment of the cold war , Eden declared : `` There must be much closer unity within the West before there can be effective negotiation with the East '' .
Obviously , the `` private eye '' can have no more appeal for Patchen .

And again , `` how can you write when you haven't yet read ' Bartleby The Scrivener ' '' ? ?
) when Krim says mine was as severe a critical-intellectual , environment as can be imagined , he is off his rocker .
That is how the real routine of resistance goes on , and its strength is directly proportionate to the number of insignificant people who can let themselves be taken to pieces , piece by piece , without quitting .
Like every Southerner I can't escape the romantic tradition of brave defeats , forlorn lost causes .
SBA can make complete facilities inventories of all small business concerns in labor surplus areas within budgetary and staff limitations .
Available , on request , from U.S. Department of Agriculture , Washington 25 , D.C. , are : Cooperative Farm Credit Can Assist In Rural Development ( Circular No. 44 ) , and The Cooperative Farm Credit System ( Circular No. 36-A ) .
We can help in the planning process
Neither growth nor a development program can be imposed on a country ; ;
Nevertheless , we can administer an aid program in such a manner as to promote the development of responsible programing .
First , we can encourage responsibility by establishing as conditions for assistance on a substantial and sustained scale the definition of objectives and the assessment of costs .
Second , we can make assistance for particular projects conditional on the consistency of such projects with the program .
Third , we can offer technical help in the formulation of programs for development which are adapted to the country's objectives and resources .
At the other end of the spectrum , where the more advanced countries can be relied upon to make well thought through decisions as to project priorities within a consistent program , we should be prepared to depart substantially from detailed project approval as the basis for granting assistance and to move toward long-term support , in cooperation with other developed countries , of the essential foreign exchange requirements of the country's development program .
External aid can only be marginal , although the margin , as in the case of the Marshall plan , can be decisive .
External aid can be effective only if it is a complement to self-help .
U.S. aid , therefore , should increasingly be designed to provide incentives for countries to take the steps that only they themselves can take .
Open societies can take many forms , and within very broad limits recipients must be free to set their own goals and to devise their own institutions to achieve those goals .
Once we have made clear that we are genuinely concerned with a country's development potential , we can be blunt in suggesting the technical conditions that must be met for development to occur .
Some of the most dramatic successes of Communism in winning local support can be traced to the identification -- correct or not -- of Communist regimes with personal honesty and pro-Western regimes with corruption .
The United States can use its aid as an incentive to self-help by responding with aid on a sustained basis , tailored to priority needs , to those countries making serious efforts in self-help .
In many instances it can withhold or limit its aid to countries not yet willing to make such efforts .
In several significant cases , such as India , a decade of concentrated effort can launch these countries into a stage in which they can carry forward their own economic and social progress with little or no government-to-government assistance .
Meantime , over the decade of the sixties , we can hope that many other countries will ready themselves for the big push into self-sustaining growth .
In still others which are barely on the threshold of the transition into modernity , the decade can bring significant progress in launching the slow process of developing their human resources and their basic services to the point where an expanded range of developmental activities is possible .
Moreover , on complex projects , design work must be completed and orders for machinery and equipment placed months or even years before construction can commence .
or a skilled labor force is trained before there are plants available in which they can be employed .
The extent to which we can persuade the less developed countries to appraise their own resources , to set targets toward which they should be working , to establish in the light of this forward perspective the most urgent priorities for their immediate attention , and to do the other things which they must do to help themselves , all on a realistic long-term basis , will depend importantly on the incentives we place before them .
What Sam Rayburn's life proves to us all is the magnificent lesson in political science that one can devotedly and with absolute dedication represent the seemingly provincial interests of one's own community , one's own district , one's own State , and by that help himself represent even better the sweep and scope of the problems of this the greatest nation of all time .
More than that , Sam Rayburn is the very living symbol of an iron-clad integrity so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrated that he can count some of his best friends in the opposition .
I pray to God that he may be spared to us for many years to come for this is an influence the United States and the whole world can ill afford to lose .
Above all , he is a person to whom a fledgling Representative can go to discuss the personal and professional problems which inevitably confront a new Congressman .
The best reason that can be advanced for the state adopting the practice was the advent of expanded highway construction during the 1920s and '30s .
While the origin of state-owned automobiles may be obscured , subsequent developments concerning the assignment , use , and management of state automobiles can be related more clearly .
This type of borrowing can be reduced to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of taxes is instituted and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year .
Little can be done about the changing of dates .
It should be kept in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial condition of that town or city .
The type of program desired can be determined by the nature and extent of the adjustments needed .
and now , therefore , do I , John A. Notte , Jr. , governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim the week of april 29th to may 7th , 1961 , as Rhode Island Heritage Week , advising our citizens that throughout this week many historic houses and beautiful gardens will be open to visitors as well as industrial plants , craft shops , museums and libraries and I earnestly urge all to take advantage of these opportunities to see as many of these places as they can during this outstanding week .
As the President has said , `` only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain that they will never be employed '' .
conduct engineering research and technical development work to determine , by laboratory and pilot plant testing , the results of the research and studies aforesaid in order to develop processes and plant designs to the point where they can be demonstrated on a large and practical scale ; ;
However , the surface temperature gradient can produce erroneous vapor-pressure measurements for the bulk liquid helium unless precautions are taken to isolate the tube ( which passes through the surface to the vapor pressure bulb ) from the liquid helium surface .
It has also been observed , in helium 2 , that large discrepancies can exist between surface vapor pressures and those pressures measured by a vapor pressure thermometer .
In this case also the design of the thermometer can be modified to reduce the helium film flow .
A study of the hydrogen line profiles indicates that a measurement of these profiles can be used to calculate a temperature for the arc plasma that is reliable to about Af percent .
My heartiest congratulations go to their successors , Orvil E. Dryfoos and John B. Oakes , who can be counted upon to sustain the illustrious tradition of the New York Times .
You can see it , for example , in the extensive efforts President Kennedy has made to enlist solid bipartisan support for his actions toward both Cuba and Laos ; ;
We simply can't tolerate further Russian weapons , including the possibility of long-range nuclear missiles , being located in Cuba .
Obviously , we can't stop them from coming in , however , just by talk .
How can the United States act ? ?
Blockade runners can be stopped -- by gunfire , if necessary -- searched and held , at least temporarily .
Pre-shaped corrugated metal sections or pre-cast concrete can be used for shelters either above or below ground .
An underground reinforced concrete shelter can be built by a contractor for about $1,000 to $1,500 , depending on the type of entrance .
Another type of shelter which gives excellent fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement of a home under construction .
Records such as diaries can be kept .
A 10-gallon garbage can , with a tightly fitting cover , could be used to keep the wastes until it is safe to leave the shelter .
A belowground basement can cut the fallout radiation to one-tenth of the outside level .
I am not easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries can be so lightly dismissed .
We can no longer rely on interdepartmental machinery `` somewhere upstairs '' to resolve differences between this and other departments .
If there is anything which we can do in the executive branch of the Government to speed up the processes by which we come to decisions on matters on which we must act promptly , that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct of our affairs .
I also hope that we can do something about reducing the infant mortality rate of ideas -- an affliction of all bureaucracies .
To cite only a few examples : The wrong man in the wrong position , perhaps even in a junior position abroad , can be a source of great harm to our policy ; ;
the attitudes of a U.N. delegate who experiences difficulty in finding adequate housing in New York City , or of a foreign diplomat in similar circumstances in our Capital , can easily be directed against the United States and all that it stands for .
I would hope that we could create the recognition in the Department and overseas that those who come across little things going wrong have the responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can do something about them .
He is expected to supervise , to encourage , to direct , to assist in any way he can .
Chewing it over with his colleagues and in his own mind , he reaches a tentative identification of the question -- tentative because it may change as he explores it further and because , if no tolerable answer can be found , it may have to be changed into one which can be answered .
Meanwhile he has been thinking about the facts surrounding the problem , facts which he knows can never be complete , and the general background , much of which has already been lost to history .
He knows that he is thinking about action in relation to a future which can be perceived but dimly through a merciful fog .
The selection of the wrong tools can mean waste , at best , and at worst an unwanted inflammation of the problem itself .
Can the President or the Secretary act under existing authority , or will new legislation and new money be required ? ?
What type of action can hope to win public support , first in this country and then abroad ? ?
For the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned by the readiness of the country to sustain it .
And , given probable public attitudes -- about which reasonably good estimates can be made -- what action is called for to insure necessary support ? ?
Perhaps existing Public Health Service , State Department and Armed Services medical facilities can be utilized .
In this way the Peace Corps can be launched with its own identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary assistance from those now responsible for United States foreign policy and our overseas operations .
The Peace Corps can either begin in very low gear , with only preparatory work undertaken between now and when Congress finally appropriates special funds for it -- or it can be launched now and in earnest by executive action , with sufficient funds and made available from existing Mutual Security appropriations to permit a number of substantial projects to start this summer .
It can then grow steadily as it proves itself and as the need for it is demonstrated .
Steps should also be taken to link the Food for Peace Program with the Peace Corps , so that foreign currencies accumulated by the sale of U.S. surplus food under P.L. 480 can be put to use to pay some of the host country expenses of Peace Corps personnel .
The extent to which participating bodies such as U. S. voluntary agencies , universities , international organizations , and the host country or institutions in the host country can and should share the cost of the Peace Corps programs must be fully explored .
It can contribute to the development of critical countries and regions .
It can promote international cooperation and good will toward this country .
It can also contribute to the education of America and to more intelligent American participation in the world .
The Peace Corps thus can add a new dimension to America's world policy -- one for which people here and abroad have long been waiting .
Our own freedom , and the future of freedom around the world , depend , in a very real sense , on their ability to build growing and independent nations where men can live in dignity , liberated from the bonds of hunger , ignorance and poverty .
This can be accomplished substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities and techniques for fire control and more resources to cope with critical fire periods , and a more intensive application of a program of prevention , detection , and control of insect and disease infestations .
the volume of timber that can be marketed , especially for small sales and the support of dependent communities and small business enterprises ; ;
The growing communications needs of this new State can best be met , as they have in other States , through the operation and development of such facilities by private enterprise .
one B-52 can do the work of several B-47's which it will replace .
But during nighttime hours the skywave radiations are reflected from the ionosphere , thereby creating the possibility of one station's rendering service , via skywave , at a much greater distance than it can through its groundwave signal , and at the same time vastly complicating the interference problem because of the still greater distance over which these skywave signals may cause interference to the signals of stations on the same and closely adjacent frequencies .
Since broadcast frequencies are very limited in number , these objectives are to some extent inconsistent in that not all of them can be fully realized , and to the extent that each is realized , there is a corresponding reduction of the possibilities for fullest achievement of the others .
During nighttime hours , because of the intense skywave propagation then prevailing , no large number of stations can be permitted to operate on one of these channels , if the wide area service for which these frequencies are assigned is to be rendered satisfactorily by the dominant stations which must be relied upon to render it .
Therefore , under our longstanding allocation rules , on some of these channels no station other than the dominant ( class 1 ) -- A ) station is permitted to operate at night , so that the 1 , -- A station can render service , interference free , wherever it can be received .
Additional class 2 , assignments for daytime operation can be made without causing destructive interference to the class 1 , stations or to each other , and by their operation provide additional service on these channels and additional local outlets for a large number of communities .
For the making of selections on the basis of excellence requires that any foundation making the selections shall have available the judgments of a corps of advisors whose judgments are known to be good : such judgments can be known to be good only by the records of those selected , by records made subsequent to their selection over considerable periods of time .
and quality of advice , added to devotion to the Foundation's purposes and ideals , we do get from our Advisory Board in measures so full that they can be appreciated only by those of us who work here every day .
It is a truism of business that no business can be better than its board of directors and its top management .
In one sense it can be said that one of the most important Brown & Sharpe products over the years has been the men who began work with the company and subsequently came to places of industrial eminence throughout the nation and even abroad .
Our current rate of incoming orders has now contracted and unless this trend can be reversed , our production for 1961 will be lower than for 1960 .
However , the healthy inventory position of the textile industry lends support to the broadly expressed belief that improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of 1961 .
Because the bobbin-to-cone winding process is a relatively high-cost operation for the mill , the almost complete automation provided by the Uniconer can mean important economies in textile production , at the same time upgrading quality .
It is equipped with electronic controls that can be set to hold precise tension and speed .
There are , nevertheless , several things that the president can do to stimulate participation and to enhance the prestige of those who are willing to exercise their privilege .
He can , for example , present significant university-wide issues to the senate .
He can encourage quality in faculty committee work in various ways : by seeing to it that the membership of each committee represents the thoughtful as well as the action-oriented faculty ; ;
To increase faculty influence and decrease tension , many presidents have established a standing advisory committee with which they can discuss problems frankly .
The president has little influence in day-by-day curricular changes , but if he looks ahead two , three , or five years to anticipate issues and throw out challenging ideas , he can open the way for innovation , and he can also have a great deal to say as to what path it will take .
Deans can form an important bridge between the president and the faculty .
The president who appoints strong men who have an all-college or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration can count on useful assistance .
One way that this can be done , other than by hiring new high-priced professors , is by constantly encouraging the department members to raise their standards of performance .
By supporting the efforts of the many faculty members who are working to attain ever higher standards , the president can encourage faculty leadership .
Indirectly he can best help them by insuring that rigorous criteria for appointment and promotion are clearly set forth and adhered to .
They can be effective , however , if their members set high standards for candidates and devote substantial time to the work .
No one can be as effective as the president in inspiring older men to welcome imaginative new teachers whose philosophy or approach to their specialties is quite different .
Trustees , faculty , and administration can consider the consequences of decisions before they are made , instead of afterwards .
Physical plant and equipment can be efficiently developed .
Proposed new programs can be examined for appropriateness to goals and for present and future financial fitness .
Here the reasonable mastery of the elements of administration can do much to free a president for his primary role .
Higher education cannot compete with the salary scales of the business world , but an educational institution can offer many potent intangible attractions to members of the business community that will offset the differences in income .
Since he can neither accept nor reject them all , he must be governed by the time and energy available for his prime professional obligations .
By sharing the load of important speeches with his colleagues , the president can develop a cadre of able spokesmen who will help to create a public perception of the university as an institution , something more than the lengthened shadow of one man .
Such high-resolution observations as these are needed at several wave lengths in order that the radio emission of the moon can be properly interpreted .
The higher heat transfer rates at the anode compared with those at the cathode can be explained by the physical phenomena occurring in free burning arcs .
Thus , direct comparisons can be drawn with free burning arcs which have been studied in detail during the past years and decades by numerous investigators ( Ref. 3 ) .
The heat losses of the holder were to be reduced as far as possible and they should be such that an accurate heat balance can be made .
By the use of various weights , data for a force-rate of shear graph can be obtained .
This , however , can only be considered approximate , as the diameter of the pulley was increased by the build-up of tape and the tape was occasionally removed from the pulley during the runs .
These experiments can be considered exploratory only .
Although the Af calculation is obvious by analogy with that for gravitational field and osmotic pressure , it is interesting to confirm it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects .
The total volume of the system above the reference height is Af , and H can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential energy of the system in terms of H .
This method can be extended to include the concentration differences caused by shear fields .
This can be justified thermodynamically in this case , and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared .
This has an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by Philippoff that `` the deformational mechanics of elastic solids can be applied to flowing solutions '' .
There is one exception to the above statement as has been pointed out , and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear , so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar .
If the mechanics are similar , we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also be similar .
The relative forces can be calculated from the various radii of curvature if we assume : ( A ) The surface tension is uniform on the surface of the drop .
If it is assumed that the formula given by Lodge of cosec Af applies , the pressure difference along the major axes can be calculated from the angle of inclination of the major axis , and from this the interfacial tension can be calculated .
Hence , the electron paramagnetic effects ( slope ) can be separated from the nuclear effects ( intercept ) .
In this way , numerical values for the relative efficacy of various detergent formulations can be obtained by measuring the reflectance ( whiteness ) of the cloth swatches before and after washing .
In addition , dirt particles can be held onto a soiled surface by sticky substances or by the surface tension of liquids , including liquid greases .
and natural waters , in addition , often contain impurities such as calcium salts which can react with soils to make them more difficult to remove .
Micelles can imbibe and hold a considerable amount of oleophilic substances so that the micelle volume may be increased as much as approximately two-fold .
Then during washing , the greasy soil rolls back at the edges so that emulsified droplets can disengage themselves from the sorbed oil mass , with the aid of mechanical action , and enter the aqueous phase .
Thus , for aqueous media , we can think of the idealized organic active as an oleophilic or hydrophobic surface-active agent , and of an idealized builder as a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active agent .
The crude picture of the detergency process thus far developed can be represented as : Af .
This effect can give rise to a blanket of micrometeorites around the Earth .
From the brightness of the F component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal light , an estimate of the particle sizes , concentrations , and spatial distribution can be derived for regions of space near the ecliptic plane .
The flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood of the Earth can be estimated by extrapolation from radar and visual meteor data .
A man can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation period of most infectious diseases .
Something of the behavior of clouds of small particles can be illustrated by the following field trials :
From these dosage isopleths it can be seen that an area of over 34,000 square miles was covered .
As can be seen from Figure 2 , an extensive area was covered by this aerosol .
As can be seen from these dosage isopleths , approximately 100 square miles was covered within the area sampled .
A solid immunity is the one effective circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be neutralized .
By scrutinizing the flowers , one can also notice that the scale bears one or two tiny warts .
Bumblebees can thus suffer severely from the onslaughts of Psithyrus , the `` cuckoo-bumblebee '' as it is called in some European countries .
Thus , the larvae of the intruder can develop at the expense of the rightful inhabitants and the store of beebread .
Its life history is much simpler than that of the truly colonial bumblebees and can serve as an example of the life cycle of many other species .
Nomia melanderi can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of the United States west of the Great Plains , for example , in Utah and central Washington .
Data on the former are scanty , but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes born at a length greater than that of any of the others , thereby lending support to the belief that the anaconda does , indeed , attain the greatest length .
Oliver's 37-1/2 feet is partly based on this report and can be accepted as probable .
When some thirteen records of newly and recently born individuals are collated , little or no correlation between length and distribution can be detected .
Anatomically , the horse lung appears to be remarkably like that of man , insofar as this can be ascertained from comparison of our findings in the horse with those of others ( Birnbaum , '54 ) in the human being .
Since a Skeletal Age rating can be made at any age during growth , from Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , or Foot as well as Hand , it seems to be the method of choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood .
The length of the arrow indicates amount of slowing or acceleration at Completion over that at Onset , and the difference in months can be read roughly by referring the arrow to the age scale along the base of each figure , or more precisely by referring to the original data in the appropriate tables .
However , the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems .
This iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems .
If tyrosine and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid , large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can be formed ( Alexander , 1959 ) .
The mechanism of this coupling has been studied in some detail with non-enzymatic systems in vitro and can be simulated by certain di-iodotyrosine analogues ( Pitt-Rivers and James , 1958 ) .
The mechanism of action of these drugs has not been completely worked out , but certain of them appear to act by reducing the oxidised form of iodine before it can iodinate thyroglobulin ( Astwood , 1954 ) .
The effect of drugs that act on the iodide-concentrating mechanism can be counteracted by addition of relatively large amounts of iodine to the diet .
This tendency can be broken either by restoring hypothalamic excitability directly or via cortico-hypothalamic pathways .
Similar effects can be induced reflexly via the baroreceptor reflexes in man and animals .
We can do this through the characteristic values and vectors of T in certain special cases , i.e. , when the minimal polynomial for T factors over the scalar field F into a product of distinct monic polynomials of degree 1 .
What can we do with the general T ? ?
If the direct-sum decomposition ( A ) is valid , how can we get hold of the projections Af associated with the decomposition ? ?
We have just observed that we can write Af where D is diagonalizable and N is nilpotent , and where D and N not only commute but are polynomials in T .
Then every linear operator T in V can be written as the sum of a diagonalizable operator D and a nilpotent operator N which commute .
It is a very interesting fact that these two problems can be handled simultaneously and this is what we shall do in the next chapter .
What can we say of the probabilities of the different possible numbers of bull's-eyes ? ?
We can escape from such a difficulty by ruling out the animal as not constituting a trial , but such a solution is not always satisfactory .
Strictly speaking , this means that the probability for each possible outcome of the experiment can be computed by multiplying together the probabilities of the possible outcomes of the single binomial trials .
A binomial experiment can produce random variables other than the number of successes .
Therefore each binomial trial can be thought of as producing a value of a random variable associated with that trial and taking the values 0 and 1 , with probabilities Q and P respectively .
In the following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense , exactly an odd number of squares can be inscribed in every such curve which does not contain an infinite number of inscribed squares .
If the vertex is at Af , and if the interior of C is on the left as one moves in the direction of increasing t , then every such corner can be found from the curve obtained by rotating C clockwise through 90-degrees about the vertex .
We can now prove several lemmas .
Near Q , both curves can be represented by analytic functions of U .
Furthermore , one can find a neighborhood of Q in which the difference function is monotone , for since it is analytic it can have only a finite number of extrema in any interval .
Thus if E is sufficiently small , there can be only one intersection of C and Af near Q , for if there were more than one intersection for every E then the difference between C and Af near Q would not be a monotone function .
The fact that there can not be any limit points of the set except in closed intervals follows from the argument used in Lemma 1 , namely , that near any tangent point in the C-plane the curves C and Af are analytic , and therefore the difference between them must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the tangent point .
With the above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of F .
Further , we see by Lemma 2 that the multiplicity of F can only change at a tangent point , and at such a point can only change by an even integer .
We observe first that no line , l , can meet its image except at one of its intersections with Q .
Moreover , from the definitive transformation of intercepts on the generators of Af , it is clear that the only points of Q at which a line can meet its image are the points of Aj .
It is interesting that a 1 : 1 correspondence can be established between the lines of two such pencils , so that in a sense a unique image can actually be assigned to each tangent .
A final class of exceptional lines is identifiable from the following considerations : Since no two generators of Af can intersect , it follows that their image curves can have no free intersections .
Now the only way in which all curves of the image family of Af can pass through a fixed point is to have a generator of Af which is not a secant but a tangent of **zg , for then any point on such a generator will be transformed into the point of tangency .
Observations similar to these can be made at each point of Aj .
Moreover , if Af , no two of the multiple secants can intersect .
But if no two lines of the regulus of multiple secants of **zg can intersect , then the regulus must be quadratic , or in other words , **zg must be either a Af or a Af curve on a nonsingular quadric surface .
These societies can expect to face difficult times .
Nevertheless , with foresight and careful planning , some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing through this stage can be escaped .
The United States can help by communicating a genuine concern with the problems these countries face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms of assistance where possible .
It may seem to some of them that success can be purchased much less dearly by fishing in the murky waters of international politics than by facing up to the intractable tasks at home .
We should do what we can to discourage this conclusion , both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene .
Progress is impeded by psychological inhibitions to effective action among those in power and by a failure on their part to understand how local resources , human and material , can be mobilized to achieve the national goals of modernization already symbolically accepted .
The colonial period has generally left people believing that government can , if it wishes , provide all manner of services for them -- and that with independence free men do not have to work to realize the benefits of modern life .
Only within the framework of a mature relationship characterized by honest appraisals of performance can we provide telling assistance .
With respect to those countries whose leaders prefer to live with their illusions , we can afford to wait , for in time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all to see .
Simultaneously we should be underlining the interrelationships of technical progress in various fields , showing how agricultural training can be introduced into education , how health affects labor productivity , how small business can benefit the rural farm community , and , above all , how progress in each field relates to national progress .
Efforts such as the Community Development Program in the Philippines have demonstrated that transitional societies can work toward balanced national development .
By holding out prospects for external capital assistance , the United States can provide strong incentives to prepare for the concerted economic drive necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth .
American and free-world policies can marginally affect the pace of transition ; ;
Religion can summate , epitomize , relate , and conserve all the highest ideals and values -- ethical , aesthetic , and religious -- of man formed in his culture .
Without a system of values there can be no society .
While some suppression and some denial are not only necessary but healthy , the worker's clinical knowledge must determine how these defenses are being used , what healthy shifts in defensive adaptation are indicated , and when efforts at bringing about change can be most effectively timed .
Willingness to take the risk of early and direct interpretation ( with the proviso that if the interpretation is too threatening , the worker can withdraw ) is another prominent feature in these efforts .
The supportive relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and social isolation .
To some extent the system can be considered a Gemeinschaft in which `` social-role occupancies are determined by birth , by attributes such as sex or caste , which are biologically or socially immutable '' .
Each family line can be considered a substructure .
By means of geographical isolation and high fertility rates , inbreeding can be fostered and the pattern of isolation from the greater society maintained .
Since morale is closely related to pattern maintenance and integration , the higher the morale and solidarity , the better the system can solve the problems of the system .
The population can thereby replenish itself and actually grow larger .
'' The external pattern or external system can be considered as `` group behavior that enables the group to survive in its environment .
It supplies local data which are useful in administration and which can be used as a basis for intensive studies in particular situations .
The quality of the census data can , therefore , be greatly improved by the use of the registration records in conjunction with the field inquiries .
It is planned to double the number of teams and to make use of improved equipment in a second demographic inquiry in 1960 , so that the inquiry can be carried through in one year and the results published more expeditiously .
I can now better see just what processes provoked certain actions from me in the past .
But few who have experienced marriage can dispute the fact that the focus of interpersonal relationships is different in marriage than in a pre-marital situation .
Whereas a high percentage of the regular students can be expected to read other texts which more or less plow the same ground in a little different direction , the married students chose whole books on specific areas and went into much greater detail in their areas of interest .
Since the writer had not noticed this characteristic in married students scattered throughout the various sections previous to this experiment , nor , as a matter of fact , in those who were continuing in `` single sections '' , he can only conclude that there must have been something `` contagious '' within the specific group which caused this to occur .
When informed that there were some persons who did not have their arm go up , she commented , `` I don't see how they can prevent it '' .
that they can give up their control and allow themselves to be reactors rather than actors .
It can be seen too that when we contrast levels of compulsivity within the structured schools , the high compulsive children do better ( Af ) .
The interaction effect , which is significant at the level , can be seen best in the contrast of mean scores .
Roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals .
For example : a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying .
Another use of roleplaying for evaluation illustrates how this procedure can be used in real life situations without special equipment or special assistants during the daily course of work .
We can see others more clearly than we can see ourselves , and others can see us better than we see ourselves .
Observers can see a person engaged in spontaneous behavior , and watch him operating in a totalistic fashion .
This behavior is more `` veridical '' -- or true -- than other testing behavior for some types of evaluation , and so can give quick and accurate estimates of complex functioning .
and only when I can acknowledge this , to myself , as being indeed an aspect of my personality , does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient's behavior .
But it is true that the therapist can sense , when he hears this stereotype , that there are at this moment many emotional determinants at work in it , a blurred babel of indistinct voices which have yet to become clearly delineated from one another .
in working with these patients the therapist eventually gets to do some at least private mulling over of the possible meaning of a belch , or the passage of flatus , not only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to analyze , but also because he learns that even these animal-like sounds constitute forms of communication in which , from time to time , quite different things are being said , long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these , as distinct feelings and concepts , to say them in words .
But first , we must define two terms so that their meaning will be clearly understood : form -- any unique sequence of alphabetic characters that can appear in a language preceded and followed by a space ; ;
dictionary information about the form stored at this location can be retrieved directly by occurrences of the form in text .
If Af was assigned as the information cell for Af , the routine can detect that Af is identical to Af by comparing Af with the form stored at location Af .
A third cell can be added by storing the address of another Y-cell in Af ; ;
If each text form is marked when matched with a dictionary form , the text forms not contained in the dictionary can be identified when all dictionary forms have been read .
The appropriate action for handling these forms can be taken at that time .
A description of this process will serve to illustrate how any type of information can be retrieved from the dictionary and attached to each text occurrence .
Hence , the description of each text occurrence can be retrieved by reading the list of text-ordered information-cell addresses and outputting the description indicated by the information cell for each occurrence .
Applying the techniques developed at Harvard for generating a paradigm from a representative form and its classification , we can add all forms of a word to the dictionary at once .
Thus , one can think of a dictionary entry as a word rather than a form .
For example , the inflected forms of a word can be represented , insofar as regular inflection allows , by a stem and a set of endings to be attached .
( Indeed , the set of endings can be replaced by the name of a set of endings .
) The full forms can be derived from such information just prior to the lookup of the form in the text-form list .
In sentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here .
Thus the unstressed it of it rarely snows here gets its significance from its use with snows : nothing can snow snow but `` it '' .
In the written language then can be underlined or italicized to guide the reader here , but much of the time the written language simply depends on the reader's alertness , and a careless reader will have to back up and reread .
Thus in it's incredible what that boy can eat dominant stress is likely to be on incredible , and eat will have strong stress also .
I can't be happy long without drinking water '' .
But the use of stress in comparison and contrast , for example , can undermine distinctions such as these .
In the Steiners have busy lives without visiting relatives only context can indicate whether visiting relatives is equivalent in meaning to paying visits to relatives or to relatives who are visiting them , and in I looked up the number and I looked up the chimney only the meanings of number and chimney make it clear that up is syntactically a second complement in the first sentence and a preposition followed by its object in the second .
They will give suggestions that can be worked up into field procedures .
This can only be for one of two reasons : either the two are quite different and will require totally different theory ( and hence techniques ) , or our existing theories are insufficiently general .
Neither can be adequately systematized until we are able to separate the two and assign the observed phenomena individually to one or the other .
In many of the syllables , intonation can be safely ignored , and much of the tonal analysis can be done without any study of intonation .
While the phonemes can be very easily stated , no one is likely to be satisfied with the statement until phonemic occurrences can be related in some way to morphemic units , i.e. until the morphophonemics is worked out , or at least far enough that it seems reasonable to expect success .
Tonal morphophonemics , in a common case , can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone .
Smaller systems can of course be stated much more succinctly .
A phonemic system can be stated without reference to morphophonemics , but it cannot always be found without morphophonemics .
As a result , many people have been confirmed in their conviction that orthography design is not an activity to which experts can contribute anything but confusion .
He concludes that some changes can be made in the current orthography which will appreciably improve its usefulness , but hesitates to suggest precise graphic devices to effect these changes .
This , however , will not exhaust their practical usefulness , as they rather clearly indicate what thorough phonologic investigation can contribute to orthography design .
It seems to me that it rather easily can .
This distribution can be summarized by averaging the distance in grades apart : Af ; ;
The practical operational problem of lexicostatistics is the establishment of a basic list of items of meaning against which the particular forms or terms of languages can be matched as the medium of comparison .
In proportion as meanings are concrete , we can better rely on their being insulated and distinctive .
Interesting evidence can be found in the results of the Chamber of Commerce elections , which took place three weeks before national elections .
The existence of a public school vocational training program in trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled .
Additional courses can readily be added and special cooperative programs worked out with any new industry if the basic facilities , staff and program are in being .
Thus , besides the training provided to youth in school , the existence of the school program can have supplementary benefits to industry which make it an asset to industrial development efforts .
Local jobs can be seen and counted , while opportunities elsewhere are regarded as more hypothetical .
A related question is whether unemployed workers can be motivated to take the training provided .
If there is adequate information on job opportunities for skilled jobs elsewhere , many more workers can be expected to respond .
According to the theory underlying odd-lot indices , the trader who trades odd lots is most likely a small trader , one who can't afford to trade round lots .
Falling most easily prey to an adverse market movement , for this rank of traders can least afford to lose , virtually anything the odd-lot traders do , marketwise , is taken to exemplify the `` wrong '' thing to do .
But after all , can anyone imagine a market wherein the reverse of these things were true ? ?
Anyone still doubting that this is the only way markets can be is invited to try to imagine a market wherein the majority consistently wins what the minority loses .
Where this approach becomes critical , the industry can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its sincerity in `` resisting '' the wage pressures of a powerful union , requesting tariff relief after it has `` reluctantly '' acceded to the union pressure .
Similarly , higher levels of GNP do not , in themselves , provide grounds for raising prices , but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase .
Thus , for non-negative changes in the basic wage rate , the industry becomes the active wage-setter , since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason of industry acquiescence .
Reluctant , as usual , to interpret state legislation -- such interpretation can only be a `` forecast rather than a determination '' -- Mr. Justice Frankfurter led a unanimous Court to vacate the injunction .
How can judges exercise jurisdiction to enforce national rights when Congress has created none ? ?
How else can one explain , for example , allowing the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium ( section 381(c)(9) ) , but not the right to amortize bond issue expenses ; ;
A recent case in point is Mitchell Canneries v. United States , in which a claim against the Government was transferred first from a corporation to a partnership , whose partners were former stockholders , and then to another corporation formed by the partners .
In that event , we can correctly say that we have received an authoritative interpretation of the matter , and one which we can follow statewide with confidence that the policy will not be overthrown in other Superior Courts .
Martin and Stendler present evidence that infants and young children can and do solve many problems at a relatively simple perceptual level simply by combining objects and counting them .
Although no national norms exist for the social development of children , the teacher can find a great deal of information concerning types of social behavior normally displayed by children at various age levels .
In early childhood the choice of a companion is likely to be for another child of his own age or a year or two older , who can do the things he likes to do ; ;
The child in the primary grades can play harmoniously with one companion , but his desire to be first in everything gets him into trouble when the group gets larger ; ;
Much progress has been made in the last two decades in developing techniques for understanding children , yet in almost any classroom today can be found children whose needs are not being met by the school program .
At any rate , the teacher who recognizes common causes of retardation and maladjustment can frequently do a great deal to eliminate the causes of pupil discouragement , failure , and maladjustment .
He can be expected , however , to examine and interpret the information already available ; ;
This section deals with some of the sources of information that can be tapped by the classroom teacher ; ;
These records , when systematically maintained , provide much information about the children , which the teacher can use in guidance , instruction , grouping , and reporting to parents .
Desegregation can also result from additional suits brought by Negro plaintiffs against school boards in Newport News , Fairfax County , Arlington County , and Norfolk .
First , how can we step up the desegregation movement ? ?
I believe we all want more schools where white and Negro together can and do attend .
Second , as we increase the number of desegregated school districts and schools themselves , how can we achieve this action through school board action ? ?
Correlatively , can we reduce the role of the district courts , so that the action is that of the people of the community or other school district and not that of the law court ? ?
Third , how can we insure a systematic and continuing group relations education in the schools ? ?
Fourth , in the segregated school system , during the period before desegregation , how can we assure equal opportunity ? ?
In fact , in the desegregated school system which may have a good many schools with all-Negro population , how can we assure equal opportunity ? ?
Fifth , in the segregated school system or in the all-Negro or all-white schools , how can we encourage better group relations or an improved attitude toward people who do not belong to the group ? ?
Can we help children adjust to `` images of other children '' when the latter are not actually present .
We can argue that where residence makes pupil desegregation impossible teacher assignment can create a partially desegregated situation .
Seldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly drawn .
While this influence is a complex matter , depending upon personality factors in the individual as well as upon his social-class experience , there probably are some general statements about social-class background and educational policy that can be made with a fair degree of truth .
Unfortunately , however , and for reasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues .
Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define `` relative costs '' , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice .
and these costs must somehow be apportioned among the various classes and then must somehow be reapportioned among the units of service in order to report unit costs that can serve as tentative measures of reasonable rates .
But the really controversial aspect of customer-cost imputation arises because of the cost analyst's frequent practice of including , not just those costs that can be definitely earmarked as incurred for the benefit of specific customers but also a substantial fraction of the annual maintenance and capital costs of the secondary ( low-voltage ) distribution system -- a fraction equal to the estimated annual costs of a hypothetical system of minimum capacity .
Is it not the task of philosophy to see what intelligible meaning can be assigned to the most sacred canons in social science ? ?
This push to confine the study of mass behaviour to the measurements of parameters involved in differential equations has led sociology perilously close to the reduction of the word `` mass '' to mean a small group in which certain relations between all pairs of individuals in such a group can be studied .
Philosophy can supply adequate criteria of meaning in the selection of socially viable categories .
In the new situation , philosophy is able to provide the social sciences with the same guidance that mathematics offers the physical sciences , a reservoir of logical relations that can be used in framing hypotheses having explanatory and predictive value .
By clarifying fundamental premises in the social sciences , and defining the logical problems emergent at the borderlands of each new scientific discipline , philosophy can offer the sort of distinction that can accelerate growth in human understanding .
Philosophy can prevent the working scientist from becoming slothful and self-content by noting the assumptions and level at which a hypothesis or theory is framed .
Certain features we have touched upon : philosophy as a logical , deductive system from which a social science methodology can be built up ; ;
Such pseudo-questions assume that answers of concrete significance can be supplied to statements involving undefined universals .
An operational approach to sociology can never expect abstract certainty , since it is certainty which every new discovery in science either replaces or reshapes .
For what concerns all scientific disciplines is precisely that which can be captured for the rational , i.e. , for the scientific determination of what in past ages was considered ultimate and irrational .
So far as I can see , there is only one way out for the positivist .
And if we can see that what we meant to say remains the same , while the feeling varies from intensity to near zero , it is not the feeling that we primarily meant to express .
Whatever the unhappy inmates of such camps are like today , Dostoevsky's companions were about as grim a lot as can be imagined .
The force of the authors' analysis ( if indeed it has any force ) can be felt by the reader , I believe , only after three questions have been successfully answered .
( 3 ) How can we be sure that his sense of touch was not profoundly disturbed by his head injury ? ?
If the argument is accepted as essentially sound up to this point , it remains for us to consider whether the patient's difficulties in orienting himself spatially and in locating objects in space with the sense of touch can be explained by his defective visual condition .
But before we can do this , we must first find answers to our original questions 1 and 2 ; ;
This would mean , it can readily be seen , that , again , for each new visual experience , the tracing motions would have to be repeated because of the absence of visual imagery .
If the patient can perceive figure kinesthetically when he cannot perceive it visually , then , it would seem , the sense of touch has immediate contact with the spatial aspects of things in independence of visual representations , at least in regard to two dimensions , and , as we shall see , even this much spatial awareness on the part of unaided touch is denied by the authors .
From even a cursory inspection of its many aspects , however , the historian can deduce several fundamental conclusions about the progress of the Aegean world down to 800 B.C.
One can take a vase of about 800 B.C. and , without any knowledge of its place of origin , venture to assign it to a specific area ; ;
The same conclusions can be drawn from the other physical evidence of the Dark ages , from linguistic distribution , and from the survivals of early social , political , and religious patterns into later ages .
The historian can only point out those lines which were major enough to find reflection in our limited evidence , and must hope that future excavations will enrich our understanding .
Can we discover what it is in Utopia that has evoked this response ? ?
it can be made in two words , Utopian communism .
Because community not severalty of property is the law of nature no man can assert an absolutely unalterable right to what is his .
Neither from one of these conceptions nor from a combination of them can it be deduced .
What that spirit and attitude were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts with the communist tradition with the longest continuous history , the one which reached Christianity by the way of Stoicism through the Church Fathers of Late Antiquity .
Editor Foss stated , `` Of their guilt there can be no doubt but they are entitled to sufficient time to prepare for trial , and a fair trial '' .
Concerning the sentence the editor asked , `` What else can Virginia do than to hang the men who have defied her laws , organized treason , and butchered her citizens '' .
It was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint .
Picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of 1911 , when he glued a piece of imitation-caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas .
And the same thing , more or less , can be said of the contents of Picasso's first collage .
In later collages of both masters , a variety of extraneous materials are used , sometimes in the same work , and almost always in conjunction with every other eye-deceiving and eye-undeceiving device they can think of .
freeways boost valuation less ( because the garages they require are not prime buildings by a long shot ) , and reduce the acreage that can be taxed .
But anybody who promises a substantial volume of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these days , and many businesses can live without the railroad .
And there are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking lot , which can be reached by driving across or against the usual pattern of rush hour traffic and grille-route bus lines , is actually more convenient than the walk-to factory .
They can even be rather grand , like Edward Land's monument to the astonishing success of Polaroid .
To the extent that the problem is merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of Lazarus Brothers in Columbus , Ohio , can fight back successfully by building a garage on the lot next door .
If the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened away from downtown by traffic problems , however , the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or await the completion of the federal highway program .
I can well understand your curiosity .
I can only hope that the continuing exchange of groups and individuals between our countries will not wear out all language pertinent to the occasion .
The thing can be made to look like the cluttered attic of a large and vigorous family -- a motley jumble of discarded objects , some outworn and some that were never useful , some once whole and bright but now chipped and tarnished , some odd pieces whose history no one remembers , here and there a gem , everything fascinating because it suggests some part of the human condition -- the whole adding up to nothing more than a glimpse into the disorderly history of the makers and users .
What matters is that while Fromm's reading of the data is not the only one possible , it is precisely the one we would expect from a writer who earnestly believes that every man can and ought to be happy and satisfied .
In view of these shortcomings in both the amount and the interpretation of survey-type findings on public opinion , and considering the criticisms which can be brought against Fromm's philosophical anthropology , such a passage as the following cannot be taken seriously .
Considering the nature of man , and the conditions for happiness , this can hardly be so '' .
The point is that in a system such as Fromm's which recognizes unconscious motivations , and which rests on certain ethical absolutes , empirical data can be used to support whatever proposition the writer is urging at the moment .
One can make them say the same thing only by not listening to them very carefully and hearing only what one wants to hear .
( We can imagine how they startled audiences of the 1870's .
The music becomes ethereal as he calls up a vision of her own sainthood : it is she , he tells her , who can bring the truth to Russia and convert the heretics .
This is not , however , the case , and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy only in a very limited sense .
From the dated poems we can venture certain conclusions about Hardy's career in poetry , always remembering that conclusions based on a fraction of the whole must remain tentative .
The second productive period , the decade from 1910 to 1920 , can be related to three events : the completion of The Dynasts in 1909 , which left Hardy free of pressure for the first time in forty years ; ;
We can see the general characteristics of the earlier decade if we look at two poems of very different qualities : `` Revulsion '' ( 1866 ) and `` Neutral Tones '' ( 1867 ) .
There is no longer any sense of continuing development of the sort that can be traced from Baudelaire to Eluard , or for that matter , from Hawthorne through Henry James to Gertrude Stein .
Even though the bondage of his verse is not so great as the writing poet can manage , it is still great enough for him often to be seriously impeded unless he has aids to facilitate rapid composition .
But we can say that since a writing poet , with leisure before him , would seem unlikely to invent a technique based upon frequent and substantial circumlocution , the kennings like the epithets must reasonably be ascribed to an oral tradition .
no individual word in The Iliad or The Odyssey can be credited to any one man ; ;
no strikingly effective element of speech in the extant poems can with assurance be said not to have been a commonplace in the vaster epic corpus that may have existed at the beginning of the first millennium before Christ .
With a few important and a few more unimportant exceptions , no expression can be deemed le mot juste for its context , because each was very probably the only expression that long-established practice and ease of rapid recitation would allow .
J. H. Miller's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective .
We take leave of Pumblechook as he gloats over Pip's loss of fortune , extending his hand `` with a magnificently forgiving air '' and exhibiting `` the same fat five fingers '' , one of which he identifies with `` the finger of Providence '' and shakes at Pip in a canting imputation of the latter's `` ingratitoode '' and his own generosity as Pip's `` earliest benefactor '' .
Each switch occupies one digit position in a word , can be set on or off , and is considered as logically equivalent to an electronic switch .
Then the enthusiasm and energy of all elements can be channeled to produce cumulative progress toward a common objective .
The result can only be confusion in the public mind .
A unified concept can serve as a guide to budgeting and , if public support is gained , will command Congressional support .
Industry's main criticism of the Navy's antisubmarine effort is that it cannot determine where any one company or industry can apply its skills and know-how .
Other countries which may willingly or unwillingly become Communist can furnish bases .

Attack can come from almost any direction against many locations .
It is often stated that the submarine can be destroyed while building , at bases , in transit , and on station .
The missile can gradually be expected to replace the torpedo .
No element can accomplish the total objective of submarine defense .
Some limitations of one element can be compensated for by a capability of another .
Conceivably the submarine defense problem can be solved by sufficient forces .
Since effective area coverage appears fairly remote , the requirement can be borne in mind while considering the elements : air , surface , sub-surface , fixed installations , mines , and intelligence .
Intelligence , as used herein , will include information on possible opponents and on the environment which can affect operations .
These can be referred to as operational intelligence and environmental intelligence .
Good operational intelligence can ensure sound planning , greatly reduce force requirements , and increase tactical effectiveness .
Full knowledge of the science of oceanography can bring the environment to our side , resulting in an increase in effectiveness of equipment and tactics , a decrease in enemy capabilities , and the development of methods of capitalizing on the environment .
Mines can be used to deny access to great areas ; ;
they are difficult to counter , cost little to maintain until required , and can be put into place quickly .
Systems which detect submarines over wide areas are attractive , although they can be only `` burglar alarms '' .

In the second-order theory , one of the normal stress differences can be calculated from the first-order stress relaxation function .
Limitations on the lengths of these sequences diminish the stability of the comparatively short crystallites which can be formed , and this is reflected in a broadening of the melting range .

Enzymatic action in stored food produces changes which can adversely affect the appearance of food or its palatability .
Ionizing radiation can cause the destruction of microorganisms and insects involved in food spoilage or , at lower doses , can inhibit their action .
Moderate radiation doses of from 100,000 to 200,000 rads can extend the shelf life ( at 35 F ) of fresh beef from 5 days to 5 or 6 weeks .
Radiopasteurization has also been successful , and the shelf life of chicken can be extended to a month or more under refrigerated storage as compared with about 10 days for the untreated product .
The measurement of topcoats on primers can also readily be carried out .
The instrumental method , however , is about 100 times more sensitive and yields numerical results which can be accurately repeated at will over a period of time .
If the coating becomes still thicker , a peeling type failure finally can occur .
It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the cutting removal of a coating from its substrate involves pure cohesive failure of the coating .
It can be seen that the force is characteristic of the removal process and changes abruptly from cutting to cracking to peeling removal .
Also , it can be readily seen that the cutting and peeling types of failure show a steady state response , while the cracking mechanism is of a dynamic nature .
It should be recalled that these three mechanisms can occur on the same coating deposited upon the same substrate merely as a function of changes in coatings thickness .
**yf can readily be determined by measuring the thickness of the coating before and after cutting from the substrate ; ;
From Fig. 6 the relationship between these parameters can readily be derived and the cutting force is Af where **yl is the shear strength of the coating and is a parameter of the coatings material , W is the width of the removed coating and T is its thickness .
The force vector concept of Fig. 6 can readily be applied to this condition also .
It can be seen that Af is a constant , and is determined for the most part by the geometry of the knife .
The value of Af can readily be assessed by determining the frictional force exerted on the knife while running over the previously stripped coating track under various external loadings .
Since the load L , under actual cutting conditions is caused by Af , it can be seen that Af
The measured force , H , in cutting removal of coatings from their substrates consequently can be seen to be the sum of that force required to cut the coating , Af , that due to the bluntness of the knife , Af , and that due to the friction between the bottom of the knife and the substrate , Af , or Af .
These theoretical relationships are more clearly illustrated in Fig. 7 and their sum can be seen to correlate in form with practical measurements made with the Hesiometer as illustrated in the first portion of Fig. 5 for the cutting mechanism .
The detailed mechanisms of this type of failure have been studied extensively by Merchant for metal cutting , and the principles found can be directly applied to coatings .
Merchant has found that the same basic relationships which describe the geometry and force systems in the case of the cutting mechanism can also be applied to the discontinuous chip formation provided the proper values of instantaneous shear angle and instantaneous chip thickness or cross-sectional area are used .
Furniture upholstery , as just one example , can easily take millions of pounds ; ;
Blowing can be either one of two types -- carbon dioxide gas generated by the reaction of water on the polyisocyanate or mechanical blowing through the use of a low-boiling liquid such as a fluorinated hydrocarbon .
Although the first polyether foams on the market had to be produced by the two-step prepolymer method , today , thanks to new catalysts , they can be produced by a one-shot technique .
The foaming can be accomplished at some future time at a different location by the addition of the correct proportion of catalyst in solution .
This property refers to the greatest longitudinal stress or tension a material can endure without tearing apart .
The foam can be made into slab stock and cut to shape , it can be molded , it can be poured-in-place , it can be applied by spray guns , etc. .
It only takes a few minutes for the foaming action to be completed and after a short cure , the material can be cut into lengths as desired .
Profile cutting machines are available which can split foam to any desired thickness and produce sine , triangle , trapezoid , and other profiles in variable heights , dimensions , etc. .
The convoluted sheets can be combined to attain certain cushioning effects mechanically rather than chemically .
Also available is a slitter which `` peels '' the inside of a folded block of foam and can be used to slit continuous sheets up to 300 yd. in length , down to 1/16 in. thick .
The low cost and ease of fabrication of the dies for three-dimensional foam cutting plus the wide variety of shapes , dimensions , and contours that can be tailor-made to customer requirements has made the technique useful for producing case liners , materials handling containers , packaging and cushioning devices , and such novelties as soap dishes , toys , head rests , arch supports , and gas pedal covers .
Only by resorting to molding techniques can the cushion manufacturer hope to compete satisfactorily in the established cushion market .
Sets of weights are provided so that the load can be selected in the range of 1/2 to 4 pounds .
As it will be discussed later , peripheral defocusing can be improved on by utilizing curved fiber couplers .
The field-flattening property of the biconcave fiber coupler can be utilized to alleviate the peripheral resolution losses resulting with a flat phosphor-screen or coupling member .
This condition can be satisfied , e.g. , with Af and Af or equivalent glass combinations .
A sufficiently good approximation for determining the end reflection losses R can be obtained from the angle independent Fresnel formula : Af .
Since we are considering here relatively small diameter ( 1 - 1.5 inches ) fiber plates , their average thickness can be kept below 1/4 inch and their internal losses may be assumed as 15 percent ( per plate ) .
It is obvious that such an influence can only be expected in the final stage of an image intensifier at rather high output levels .
At the same time , every device that can be employed to reduce the number of variables is of the greatest value , and it is one of the attractive features of dynamic programming that room is left for ingenuity in using the special features of the problem to this end .
When the policy has been chosen , the state of the product can be obtained from the state of the feed by repeated application of the transformation ( 1 ) ; ;
The policy may not be unique but the maximum value of P certainly is , and once the policy is specified this maximum can be calculated by ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) as a function of the feed state Af .
The sequence of equations ( 6 ) can be solved for Af when Af is known , and clearly Af , the maximization being over all admissible Af .
Proceeding in this way up the table we extract the complete optimal policy and , if it is desired , we can check on Af by evaluating Af at the last stage .
We can , however , maximize its expected value .
Thus if the gyro and platform-controller combination maintains the platform with zero angular deviation about the **yf axis , the system can be rotated with an angular velocity Af if a torque is supplied to the gyro output axis Aj .
It is assumed that the gyros are designed with electrical torquers so that a torque can be applied about their output axes .
However , the leveling operation can be maintained and controlled remotely with no mechanical or optical contact with the platform .
The leveling process can be accomplished manually , and the results are as satisfactory as those obtained with automatic equipment .
With integration , the effect of a small acceleration ( or small platform tilt angle ) can be seen after a time .
With the gyro-stabilized platform leveled , it can be headed in the proper direction by using surveying techniques .
This can be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing surveying techniques .
When the platform is aligned , the reflected image of the crossed hairs can be seen exactly superimposed upon the original crossed hairs .
The images can easily be aligned with a high degree of accuracy .
However , this difficulty is not too serious if it is realized that a surveying team can establish a true north base line with a few days' work .
If the platform is not too high off the ground , a transit can be mounted on a stand to raise it up to the platform .
The transit can be replaced by an autocollimator .
This instrument provides an electrical signal proportional to the angular deviations of the platform and can be used to automatically hold the platform on true heading .
If the drift error is systematic , it can be canceled with a bias circuit which can be arranged and adjusted to supply the required compensating current .
The sensing of this rotation by the X gyro can be utilized to direct the platform into proper heading .

Shorn of all their riders , special provisions , and other bells and whistles , insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories : so-called pure insurance , which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death , and permanent insurance , which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive .
Even if you 're healthy and can renew , your premium will go up sharply because you 're that much older .
The word `` death '' can not be escaped entirely by the industry , but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms , preferring to talk about `` savings '' and `` investment '' instead .
But the percentage of your cash reserve that you can borrow tax-free is very small .
I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment ; I can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year ; and I can even skip payments if my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion of the policy .
Projecting the latter over several decades , I find my cash buildup is impressive -- but can any high interest rate prevail for that long ?
Yes , he says , premiums on such variable-rate coverage can be structured to `` vanish '' after a certain period -- but usually only if interest rates stay high enough to generate sufficient cash to cover the annual cost of insurance protection .
But the catastrophic events for which the policyholder can collect are narrowly defined , vary from policy to policy , and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face amount of insurance .
A person can do some heavy thinking about insurance there -- and shop for something more exciting while she 's doing it .
`` We can support the American flag without changing the American Constitution , '' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine .
Mr. Bush said he would allow the bill to become law without his signature , because he said only a constitutional amendment can protect the flag adequately .

IT IS N'T TRUE that a 90-year old clergyman on a mission of mercy to a disaster area on Christmas Day can fly free .
But his circumstances are among the few that can qualify for the handful of really cheap airline tickets remaining in America .

Among the souped-up indexing strategies : Indexed portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks , or just a few dozen , rather than being restricted to the S&P 500 companies .
They can ignore the S&P 500 stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks , such as smaller companies , those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry , state or country .
With today 's computer-driven program trading techniques , index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the S&P 500 .
Futures and options also make it possible to build `` synthetic '' index funds that do n't actually own a single share of stock , but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market .
Plain-vanilla funds have become so commonplace that fees they can charge have plunged to almost nothing , and in some cases are just that .
Instead of hiring one of the many active managers specializing in growth stocks , indexers can design a portfolio around the same stocks ; the portfolio will be maintained by computer , reducing both fees and , in theory , risk -LRB- because of the large number of stocks -RRB- .
One simple approach is to exclude S&P 500 companies considered bankruptcy candidates ; this can avoid weak sisters , but also can hurt when a company like Chrysler Corp. rebounds .
Indexes can be constructed to serve social goals , such as eliminating the stocks of companies doing business in South Africa .
Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it , betting that the stock 's price will decline and that they can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender .

When things are quiet -LRB- low volatility -RRB- , the structures on which markets stand can be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately .
Lack of important , needed information can cause fear .

State law enforcers can barely keep up with charity scams , and reports from watchdog groups such as the Council of Better Business Bureaus are not encouraging .
On this basis , `` there 's no way the average person can know a good charity from a bad one , '' says David Ormstedt , an assistant attorney general in Connecticut .
The charity admits spending a lot on fund raising , but says that was necessary to establish a donor base it can tap at much lower cost in years to come .
While they can target some of the most obvious miscreants , enforcers concede that they are only scratching the surface .
The established charities are bothered by this but say they can do little about it .

Some of this buying was by Japan , which has had its supplies sharply reduced by long production stoppages at the Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea , Highland Valley mine in British Columbia , and the Cananea mine in Mexico , which are major shippers to Japan .

El " Cancionero general del franquismo " de Manuel V√°zquez Montalban es " una caja negra de la sensibilidad de un pueblo " que permite recuperar la memoria de una √©poca a trav√©s de las canciones que se emit√≠an radiof√≥nicamente y el uso que de ellas hizo el propio pueblo .
Con canciones como " Mi Jaca " , " La parrala " , " Tatuaje " , " Raska yu " , " Yo vendo unos ojos negros " " La luna. el toro " , hasta m√°s de cuatrocientas composiciones , la mayor√≠a de ellas coplas , el autor hace un inventario de las canciones que alimentaron el gusto popular durante la postguerra hasta llegar. 1975 , con el cap√≠tulo " Pasi√≥n. muerte de la sentimentalidad franquista " .
El proyecto del libro , publicado por " Cr√≠tica " , comenz√≥ hace muchos a√±os y formaba parte de dos vol√∫menes que se iban a editar en 1972 , a√±o en que " Lumen " sac√≥ el primer tomo dedicado a las canciones consumidas en Espa√±a desde 1939. 1970 .
El segundo volumen , en el que se agrupaban las canciones por su diversificaci√≥n tem√°tica , qued√≥ en suspenso a causa de las dificultades que puso la Sociedad General de Autores , por lo que el cancionero completo de V√°zquez Montalban ha tenido que esperar casi treinta a√±os para salir a la calle .
Dividido en los grandes apartados : " Cancionero historificado " y " Cancionero tem√°tico " , la obra refleja desde la canci√≥n nacional , la testimonial o sentimental , hasta el erotismo , la religi√≥n , la familia o la tipolog√≠a femenina , entre otras .
" El cancionero refleja el uso que el p√∫blico hac√≠a de la propuesta cultural y de los mensajes que escuchaban a trav√©s de la radio .
La gente viv√≠a otra vida diferente de lo que se le estaba proponiendo y eso es lo que se muestra en las canciones " , se√±al√≥ el autor durante la presentaci√≥n del libro .
Para V√°zquez Montalban lo interesante ha sido " el uso que hac√≠a el p√∫blico receptor de la canci√≥n , que pod√≠a tener en √©l la misma repercusi√≥n que la poes√≠a culta " , como ocurre con " No te mires en el r√≠o " que es una traslaci√≥n de una de las poes√≠as del Cancionero de Garc√≠a Lorca , " pero traducido al lenguaje popular " .
" Es una √©poca cerrada y terminada " , en opini√≥n del autor quien record√≥ que temas como " Mi Jaca " se escuchaban durante la guerra civil en los dos bandos , " una canci√≥n que hab√≠a nacido veinte a√±os antes .
Hoy en d√≠a las canciones , salvo excepciones , duran dos meses " .
Los m√°s j√≥venes y los lectores del siglo XXI podr√°n , a trav√©s de este cancionero , recordar una parte de la cultura popular espa√±ola en la fase de preformaci√≥n del mercado de la industria cultural .
Aunque en la actualidad la copla se sigue interpretando " a la tonadillera no se le abastece de canciones que perduren .
Si en a√±os anteriores las canciones respond√≠an a una cultura que estaba dirigida por la pol√≠tica , en la actualidad el mercado es el que dirige esa cultura , " ahora estamos a r√©gimen de monocultivo en la canci√≥n " .
